                        <p><strong>
What does Walter want to do with the insurance check?
</strong></p><p>In the story of A Raisin in the Sun, Walter Lee, the only son of the Mom in the story, wanted to use the insurance money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He thinks that investment is the solution to end the family's financial problems.
</p><p>
</p><p>But keep in mind that all family members wanted different things from the insurance check which cost $10,000, an amount that is really worth a bunch for the family back then.  </p><p>
</p><p>For once, Mom, wanted to buy a house. It was something that she and her husband have dreamt of a long time ago. Ruth, Walter's wife, agrees with Mom she just wants a bigger space for their son. On the other hand, aside from what Walter wanted, the only daughter, Beneatha wanted to use the money for her medical school tuition.  </p><p>
</p><p>The story was set in the aftermath of World War II and is centered in the story of the Younger family who received an insurance check from the late Mr. Younger. And while the family is fighting with each other on what to do with the insurance check, the family were also in the war against racism in the slums of Chicago.  </p><p>
</p><p>An example of this when Mom wanted to purchase and move to Clybourne Park and be with the whites but the whites then have been oppressive that they had to almost bribe them in order to cancel their decision to move in to the community - a clear example of racism.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>ABOUT THE STORY</strong></p><p>A Raisin in the Sun is written by author Lorraine Hansberry. She was a writer and a playwright. Hansberry is also the first African-American female author who was able to have her play performed on Broadway.  </p><p>
