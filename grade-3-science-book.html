Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality. Materials to be used: • Pencil REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Directions: From the box/frame shown below, draw the picture/ caricature of your wonderful dreams in life, then discuss the description of your dreams below. Open again your SLMs, book or search on the internet to get the statements of the laws of motion, and meaning of work, power and energy. Put the references of citing below. Do this in a short bond paper with 1 cm margins. • Any coloring materials available • Ruler • Short bond paper​</a>

Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality. Materials to be used: • Pencil REFLECTIVE JOURNAL Directions: From the box/frame shown below, draw the picture/ caricature of your wonderful dreams in life, then discuss the description of your dreams below. Open again your SLMs, book or search on the internet to get the statements of the laws of motion, and meaning of work, power and energy. Put the references of citing below.
