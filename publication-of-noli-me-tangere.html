                                            Guys patulong po kung paano pa gawan ng maikling report about sa topic na to?          HISTORY O. THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

The spaces between the bookshelves are large enough to allow students to pass easily and go from case to case. The room is large, well ventilated, and well lighted. We can easily read the titles of the books - The Little Prince, Noli Me Tangere, Cinderella, and etcetera. The library is a popular place for students.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________     2. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________B. We went on a trip to Tagaytay last weekend. We decided to go there so we can get  a splendid view of Taal Lake and Taal Volcano. Tagaytay is quite far from Manila so I decided to entertain myself by observing vehicles heading towards the same direction. I saw a jeep transporting fruits, a minivan, a bus full of passengers , and a truck transporting pigs. Soon I got bored with it and decided to think of games we could do in the park. We could play hide and seek, tug of war, and luksong tinik. I can't wait to get to Tagaytay.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________      2.  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                            8. what do you know about the publication of noli me tangere and how it affected the philippines?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jose Rizal finished writing Noli Me Tangere in 1887</strong>. He initially feared that he would not be able to publish the book due to financial constraints. However, a friend, Maximo Viola came to the rescue and lent the hesitant Rizal <strong>Php 300</strong> for 2,000 copies of the book. The book was eventually published and by March 21, 1887, Rizal sent a copy of the book to his friend Blumentritt. Despite initial issues, the publication of the book brought about needed change in the Philippines and this is what know about the publication of Noli Me Tangere and below is how it affected the Philippines.</p><p>
</p><p>
The reason Jose Rizal wrote this is to show other Filipinos how the Spaniards mistreated the Filipinos and discriminated them because there is no way Filipinos can talk about this with the Spaniards around them. This novel encouraged Filipinos to rise for a revolution to fight for the freedom of the country and its citizens from the hands of these mistreating Spaniards. The book was banned by the Spaniards, for obvious reasons but of course, Filipinos found a way to smuggle the book into the country. The second and Philippine edition was printed in 1899 in Manila by <strong>Chofre y Compania</strong> in Escolta. I attached the cover page of the second edition for reference. This was different from the initial cover page in the original manuscript.

                            9. what have you learned from the lesson noli me tangere after its first public​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Noli me tangere or touch me not... was the most controversial novel of Rizal aside from the predicaments he encountered just to publish this novel. He did it to ridicule the friars and let the Filipinos be awoke of the oppression and learn to fight. It contained all the immoralities of the spaniards. So I think the lessons we can get from it is learn how to fight in a peaceful manner, fighting doesnt need a bolos, a sumpit or lantakas but it can also be possible using your pen, your wisdom. As a Filipino we should learn to be united in deeds avoiding the et empera policy that the spanish brought to us.</p><br />

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

We went on a trip to Tagaytay last weekend. We decided to go there so we can get  a splendid view of Taal Lake and Taal Volcano. Tagaytay is quite far from Manila so I decided to entertain myself by observing vehicles heading towards the same direction. I saw a jeep transporting fruits, a minivan, a bus full of passengers , and a truck transporting pigs. Soon I got bored with it and decided to think of games we could do in the park. We could play hide and seek, tug of war, and luksong tinik. I can't wait to get to Tagaytay.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________      2.  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
