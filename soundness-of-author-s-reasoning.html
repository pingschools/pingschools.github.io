                                            Additional Activities Read the article below. Note the main ideas and supporting details. Developing Children's Self Esteem Adeluisa S. Calma People who feel good about themselves embrace the fact that they may make positive contributions to their company, community, school, or any other "cause" greater than themselves, according to psychologists. Children come to respect their own contributions to the family's teamwork by becoming a member of the family organization and understanding that their feelings and views are respected. A child's self-worth is shaped by the overall environment of the home and how the family members treat the child. Fostering a positive home environment and well-functioning family can be achieved by building a family environment of shared support and motivation for each family member Rather than nagging or comparing their children, parents should educate, listen, and collaborate with them. This will foster a deep sense of belongingness and collaboration. Parents must recognize that their adolescent children are fighting their own wars. Their self- confidence is shaky. They crave attention from their peers in order to receive the love and affection they deserve. And if they are often confusing, they are still respected members of the family. They must participate, relate, and comprehend their parents' beliefs. Mutual agreements should be made between family members, so everyone knows what is expected of them. Instead of being authoritarian, parents must be leaders. They should provide leadership so that their children will learn to be more self-sufficient; listen to the children's thoughts and feelings with empathy and sympathy. Taking time for problem solving teaches values while it expresses love and concern. And lastly, it is important to value family traditions. Family rituals build belongingness, self-image and competence when everyone contributes to it. These are special occasions such as marriages, baptisms, and graduations. A family that lives time-honored tradition builds real strength and closeness. The deeper its roots go; the happier members feel about themselves and their self-esteem rises. As a result, foster a sense of self- esteem in your household. Task 1: Present the author's claim and evidences using a graphic organizer. Evidence Claim Task 2: Refer to your answer on Task 1.

                                            Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid?

                            4. Additional Activities Read the article below. Note the main ideas and supporting details. Developing Children's Self Esteem Adeluisa S. Calma People who feel good about themselves embrace the fact that they may make positive contributions to their company, community, school, or any other "cause" greater than themselves, according to psychologists. Children come to respect their own contributions to the family's teamwork by becoming a member of the family organization and understanding that their feelings and views are respected. A child's self-worth is shaped by the overall environment of the home and how the family members treat the child. Fostering a positive home environment and well-functioning family can be achieved by building a family environment of shared support and motivation for each family member Rather than nagging or comparing their children, parents should educate, listen, and collaborate with them. This will foster a deep sense of belongingness and collaboration. Parents must recognize that their adolescent children are fighting their own wars. Their self- confidence is shaky. They crave attention from their peers in order to receive the love and affection they deserve. And if they are often confusing, they are still respected members of the family. They must participate, relate, and comprehend their parents' beliefs. Mutual agreements should be made between family members, so everyone knows what is expected of them. Instead of being authoritarian, parents must be leaders. They should provide leadership so that their children will learn to be more self-sufficient; listen to the children's thoughts and feelings with empathy and sympathy. Taking time for problem solving teaches values while it expresses love and concern. And lastly, it is important to value family traditions. Family rituals build belongingness, self-image and competence when everyone contributes to it. These are special occasions such as marriages, baptisms, and graduations. A family that lives time-honored tradition builds real strength and closeness. The deeper its roots go; the happier members feel about themselves and their self-esteem rises. As a result, foster a sense of self- esteem in your household. Task 1: Present the author's claim and evidences using a graphic organizer. Evidence Claim Task 2: Refer to your answer on Task 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Obama addressed the subjects of racial tensions, white privilege, and race and inequality in the United States, discussing black "anger", white "resentment", and other issues as he sought to explain and contextualize Wright's controversial comments.</p><p></p><p>2.) As the former president Barack Obama said, "Let's be clear, There are no winners here" as he signed the stop-gap bill. He explained fully the enumerated implementations and its advantages and future benefits. ... But still, some people don't put their trust on Barack Obama's words.</p><p></p><p>3.)

                            6. Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid?
