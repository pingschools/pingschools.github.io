                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Consanguineal kin (or consanguines) are relatives related "by blood" (to use the common but inaccurate English term), meaning those people with whom you share known common ancestors, however distant. Affinal kin, or affines, are relatives by marriage or your in-laws; if the marriage ends, they are no longer affines.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:The essence of family togetherness and harmony is that Confucius largely emphasized the importance of family within the society, as well as of harmony in maintaining social relationships and societal stability.

                            23. why does confucianism promote or believe in family by affinity than family by consanguinity</h2><br />
                        <p>Confucianism emphasizes the importance of relationships and social harmony, and one of the key ways to achieve this is through strong family bonds. In traditional Confucian societies, family by affinity (meaning relationships formed through marriage) was often considered just as important, if not more so, than family by consanguinity (meaning relationships based on blood ties). This is because marriage was seen not just as a personal union, but as a way to establish alliances and strengthen relationships between families and communities. Additionally, the emphasis on filial piety in Confucianism, which stresses the duty of children to care for and respect their parents, was often extended to include one's family by affinity as well.</p><br />
