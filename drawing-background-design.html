                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person via droplets, contact, and fomites. It is transmitted when one individual talks, sneezes, or coughs producing ‘droplets’ of saliva containing the COVID-19 virus. These droplets are then inhaled by another person. COVID-19 transmission usually occurs among close contacts -- including family members and healthcare workers. It is therefore important to maintain a distance of more than 1 meter away from any person who has respiratory symptoms.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>salamat</p><br />
