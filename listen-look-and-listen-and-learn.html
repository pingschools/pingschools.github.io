                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Drug control policies and strategies must be evidence-based, socially acceptable, cost-effective, and rights-based and should be designed to minimize the adverse health, psychological, social, economic and criminal justice consequences of drug abuse towards the goal of attaining a society that is free from crime and drug and substance abuse.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>When Rodrigo R. Duterte assumed the presidency in 2016, his administration launched the relentless campaign against illegal drugs. The drug problem in the Philippines has primarily been viewed as an issue of law enforcement and criminality, he made it as one of his top campaign promises to solve the dug problem in the county and consequently, the government has focused on implementing a policy of criminalization and punishment.  </p><p>Since the start of the “war on drugs,” the Duterte government has applied all types of punitive measures and has mobilized the Philippine National Police and local government units in the whole nation. President Duterte’s war on drugs is morally and legally indefensible and has created significant and problemativ human rights violations; and is also counterproductive in addressing the drug problem.
</p><p>We should recognize that the drug problem in our country is both a complex and multi-faceted problem. Our drug problem includes not only criminal justice issues but also economic and public health issues.  </p><p>
