                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Current Technology in Genetic Engineering
<p>
</p><p><strong>Human cloning</strong>
</p><p>Cloning has become a mainstream issue when Dolly, the first cloned sheep, was unveiled to the public. Since then, many people have been wondering if the same can be done to humans. As for me, I don’t agree with cloning humans because it is unethical. I am hoping that human cloning would not be pursued by scientists.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Two Genetic Regions</strong>
</p><p>I don’t agree with using genetic engineering in changing the human chromosome.
</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Genetic Engineering for Solving COVID-19</strong>
</p><p>COVID-19 resulted to the collapse of the economy and the health industry. Using genetic engineering in solving the pandemic can be a great way to search for solutions. I agree in using the locusts to find new cures.
