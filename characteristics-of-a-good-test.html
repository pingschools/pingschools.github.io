                        <strong>What is the difference between jelly and jam?</strong><p><strong>Jelly is made with strained fruit juice. There are no pieces of fruit in jelly. Jam is made with mashed fruit.</strong></p><strong>How did you test for its jellying point?</strong><p><strong>When the mixture first starts to boil, the drops will be light and syrupy. As the syrup continues to boil, the drops will become heavier and will drop off the spoon two at a time. When the two drops form together and "sheet" off the spoon, the jellying point has been reached.</strong></p><strong>What are the good characteristic of jelly?</strong><p><strong>A fruit jelly should be of a good color, a transparent mass which will quiver, not flow, when taken from the mold, with texture so tender that it may be cut easily with a spoon, and yet so firm that the angles produced by cutting retain their shape.</strong></p><strong>What are the good characteristic of jam?</strong><p><strong>The most important qualities of good jams are taste, aroma, colour and nutrient content. The taste is closely linked with the sugar and acid content and the relationship between them.</strong></p><strong> Have you encounter any problem in cooking your sugar concentrated products?What are they?</strong><p><strong>Overcooking as this lowers the jellying capacity of pectin.Using too much water to extract the juice.</strong></p><strong>How can you avoid the failure in jelly, jam, marmalade and preserve making?​</strong><p><strong>Using Enough Sugar: Typically jams use roughly equal amounts of fruit to sugar. This is important for both how the jam sets and that it is preserved correctly. As mentioned above sugar absorbs moisture which is vitally important to keep spoilage microbes at bay. To make you jam last longer enough sugar is required.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong><strong></strong><strong>PA BRAINLIEST THANKS</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.➪Dressmakers help people enhance their body assets and hide their flaws. Just like makeup, clothes are the basic things that can help in enhancing whatever asset a person has and be able to hide whatever flaws that person wants to keep private.</p><p></p><p>2.➪The difference between a tailor and dressmaker is primarily their clientele. A dressmaker specialises in clothes for women, and a tailor generally makes clothes for men. Males and females have different body shapes that call for a different approach to pattern making, garment cutting and construction.</p><p></p><p>3.➪</p><p>•Patience</p><p></p><p>Patience is something tailors have to essentially possess. There will be different orders for different types of clothes. Further, there will be clients who are demanding and some of them can have bad attitudes. A dressmaker will always be patient and professional regardless of the situation he or she is and handle things calmly.</p><p></p><p>•Creativity</p><p></p><p>Dressmakers usually don’t limit themselves to one particular method or design. A good dressmaker will always make sure to add a little bit of creativity into the work produced by him or her. For an instance, if the dressmaker has to create a best tailor in Bangkok out of scratch, it will not be done well without creativity. The creativeness of the dressmaker is what adds more value to the clothes that they produce.</p><p></p><p>•Attention to details</p><p></p><p>A good dressmaker will always make sure to pay attention to even the smallest of the details. They get many orders from different clients for made to measure shirts and the requirements for orders will certainly differ. Therefore, a dressmaker will make sure to give his or her fullest attention. This is important and any good professional will ensure this because otherwise can lead to mistakes and loss of clients.</p><p></p><p>•Knowledge</p><p></p><p>A good dressmaker will be a well- knowledgeable person and will know what he is doing. Dressmaking is a constant process of learning and only a true professional will know what needs to be done in problematic situations. This comes with knowledge and experience.</p><p></p><p>•Working on time</p><p></p><p>Working on time is essential for any profession. A good dressmaker will make sure that the given orders are ready to be handed over to the customers on time. This is essential in order to retain customers.</p><p></p><br />
