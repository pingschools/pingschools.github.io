Dr Angelo Jesus Arias, a psychiatrist based in Dumaguete City and a director of the Philippine Psychiatric Association, says the number, and distribution, of mental health workers is the most concerning aspect of the current situation. ______17. As COVID-19 continues its rampant run across Filipino communities, it’s predicted that cases of anxiety and depression will spike, and the country's mental healthcare systems may be totally unprepared. ______18. MANILA, Philippines - With the Philippines poised to endure unprecedented periods of quarantine, isolation, and uncertainty, experts are now bracing for a nationwide mental health epidemic. ______19. Dr Arias remained assured that he, and other clinicians, will continue to do all they can to treat patients that come their way.  But until the government changes course, the mental health of millions of Filipinos will hang totally in the balance. – Rappler.com ______ 20. If you look at the composition of psychiatrists in the Philippines, there are only 600 for a population of over 100 million. 400 of those are in Metro Manila. So, mental health and psychiatric care was already a massive challenge for provincial areas and other cities even before the pandemic, let alone now when the risk of succumbing to mental illness is greater,” he said. ​</a>

                                            Directions: Compute the desirable body weight value for Filipinos (DBW-F) and the total energy requirement (TER) using the given height of individuals. Show your computation process. Number 1 is given for you as an example.
1. 145cm
Example: DBW value = 145cm-100
= 45kg
DBW-F = 45 x .10
= 4.5
= 45 - 4.5
= 40.5 kg or 41 kg
TER = 41 kg x 40
= 1,640 calories
THERFORE, an athlete or performer with a height of 145 cm has a DBW-F of 41 kg and should have a total energy requirement of 1,640 calories.

                                            WEEK N bio Assessment I. 1-5. Read the sample comparison-and-contrast paragraph below. Identify the transitional words or phrases used to develop ideas. Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I did not leave my homeland, the Philippines. The Philippines has a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514,000 square kilometers. This shows that Filipinos are 100 million in number, and most of them practice Catholicism. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67 million, and most of them are Buddhists. The Philippines has a unitary presidential constitutional form of government, whereas Thailand has a constitutional monarchy administered by a military junta. Despite these few differences, both countries share almost the same tropical climate ranging from rainy to dry and warm, and humid to cool in some inclusive months. Thais and Filipinos are alike in physical features and both speak English as the second language. Just like the Philippines, Thailand also faces environmental issues such as air pollution from vehicular emissions, water pollution from organic and factory wastes, soil erosion, and wildlife population threats. These are only a few of the similarities and differences between the two countries. There are still a lot more things about them to learn and discover. ED​</a>

He does this by suggesting that, since the majority agrees, the reader should too.

Dr Angelo Jesus Arias, a psychiatrist based in Dumaguete City and a director of the Philippine Psychiatric Association, says the number, and distribution, of mental health workers is the most concerning aspect of the current situation. ______17. As COVID-19 continues its rampant run across Filipino communities, it’s predicted that cases of anxiety and depression will spike, and the country's mental healthcare systems may be totally unprepared. ______18. MANILA, Philippines - With the Philippines poised to endure unprecedented periods of quarantine, isolation, and uncertainty, experts are now bracing for a nationwide mental health epidemic. ______19. Dr Arias remained assured that he, and other clinicians, will continue to do all they can to treat patients that come their way.  But until the government changes course, the mental health of millions of Filipinos will hang totally in the balance. – Rappler.com ______ 20. If you look at the composition of psychiatrists in the Philippines, there are only 600 for a population of over 100 million. 400 of those are in Metro Manila. So, mental health and psychiatric care was already a massive challenge for provincial areas and other cities even before the pandemic, let alone now when the risk of succumbing to mental illness is greater,” he said. ​</h2><br />

                            30. WEEK N bio Assessment I. 1-5. Read the sample comparison-and-contrast paragraph below. Identify the transitional words or phrases used to develop ideas. Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I did not leave my homeland, the Philippines. The Philippines has a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514,000 square kilometers. This shows that Filipinos are 100 million in number, and most of them practice Catholicism. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67 million, and most of them are Buddhists. The Philippines has a unitary presidential constitutional form of government, whereas Thailand has a constitutional monarchy administered by a military junta. Despite these few differences, both countries share almost the same tropical climate ranging from rainy to dry and warm, and humid to cool in some inclusive months. Thais and Filipinos are alike in physical features and both speak English as the second language. Just like the Philippines, Thailand also faces environmental issues such as air pollution from vehicular emissions, water pollution from organic and factory wastes, soil erosion, and wildlife population threats. These are only a few of the similarities and differences between the two countries. There are still a lot more things about them to learn and discover. ED​</h2><br />
