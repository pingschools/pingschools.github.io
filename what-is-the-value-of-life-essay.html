                            1. what is values in life
essay</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>In life, Values give us clear goals. They always tell us how we should behave and act in different situations and give the right direction to our life. In life, a person with good values can take better charge.<p>Values are qualities that one considers to be worthwhile and as such, act as the driving force in their lives. A person’s values take precedence over other qualities and therefore dictate the manner in which an individual may act in particular instances. In my life, I have a number of values that I hold.These values are as a result of my upbringing, my principles in life as well as my socialization. In this essay, I shall identify the core values that I hold and the manner in which they influence my everyday choices, actions and plans that I make.</p><p>One of the educational values that are fundamental to me is achievement. This is as a result of my belief that what defines me most as a person is my determination to succeed and my desire to make a positive contribution to society through my career. Achievement is therefore one of the values that is most important to me since in today’s world, achievement and success are mostly tied together with educational success. As a result of this, I hold my educational exploits in high esteem since education is one of the avenues where one’s determination leads to quantifiable success. One of the constant realities in human life is that we will always be surrounded by needy people. As such, on a social level, I always strive to give my services to the less fortunate. In my opinion, a life well lived is one that is lived in such a way that it makes a difference to someone else’s life. This is the philosophy with which I have led my life up to this point and at all times, I try to make a difference in the lives of the people that surround me. Helping other people is therefore a value that I value not only in myself but also in other people.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>you’ll know. The more that you know, the more places you’ll go.” — Dr. Seuss.</p><p></p><p>As any English-speaking child can tell you, there is no denying Dr. Seuss. If you love to read, but you’re a little afraid of reading a full-on novel in English, don’t worry. We’re going to help you get there, step by step.</p><p></p><p>With every book you read, the more you’ll improve your English reading skills.</p><p></p><p>To get started, there are some excellent novels written in English that are not too difficult to understand. Anyway, it’s good to set yourself a language challenge now and again. How else are you going to improve in English?</p><p></p><p>Reading is rewarding.</p><p>Being able to read a novel in another language and understand it is a huge achievement.

People get frustrated when they choose books that go above their reading levels. By choosing your first English books wisely, you should have a very positive experience.</p><p></p><p>If you enjoy this type of entertaining language learning, you can get a similar experience with FluentU.</p><p></p><p>FluentU takes real-world videos—like music videos, movie trailers, news and inspiring talks—and turns them into personalized language learning lessons.</p><p></p><p>Each video comes with interactive captions, so you can instantly get definitions for any unfamiliar words.
