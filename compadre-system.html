The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</a>

One time her boyfriend Mark who is the judge of the Regional Trial Court of Calamba was assassinated by the unknown armed men. One evening, she received a call from her friend saying that she has to meet her old client and friend. Upon coming to her office, she received her former client and friend Zandy. Zandy confessed that she is the one who commanded the assassins to assail the judge. Unknown to Zandy is the relationship between the celebrity lawyer and the deceased judge. However, before they talked, both signed an agreement that says that what shall transpire in their conversation shall be considered as privileged communication. Zandy asked Atty. Nathalie to be her legal counsel. Atty. Nathalie Joy and her deceased fiancé highly believe in the sanctity of the legal profession. If you are Atty. Nathalie Joy, what will you do?2. Victoria, the mother of Rico, is known to be a church servant in their Local Church. One night while she was preparing for diner, suddenly, her son came rushing to her. This son of hers confessed that her girlfriend Gayle was found pregnant. Her girlfriend, being a minor, told her parents that she was just simply seduced by her boyfriend that is why they ended up with a child in her womb. Frederico, the father of Gayle and a military sergeant, becomes furious and hunts the lover of his daughter to harm the latter. Afraid of the father of Gayle, Aling Victoria brought his son to Pastor Denggoy, the eldest brother of Vicoria, to seek refuge for his son. It so happened that the said pastor and Frederico are “compadres” because the former is one of the godfathers of Gayle in her baptism. If you are Pastor Denggoy, what will you do? 3. During a buy-bust operation conducted by the PNP San Gabriel City, the daughter of the incumbent city mayor, Chenelyn, was accosted by the policemen in pot – session. There is a strong public belief that Chenelyn is behind the rampant drug activities in his town. During the preliminary investigation, Dr. Nicole, the resident criminal laboratory doctor is given the task of conducting a drug test to the accosted daughter of the city mayor. Dr. Nicole is known for her credibility for her profession and is even recognized by the United Nations as one of the excellent practitioners in her field. In the afternoon before she would conduct the drug test for the accused, she received a call from her mother, who was a victim of a drugrelated crime, saying that she must perform the drug test well. After a few minutes, the city mayor himself shows up and offers 1.5 million pesos surety just to falsify her soon to be findings. The mayor indirectly conveyed that if she does anything against his will, evil may befall on Dr. Nicole’s family. Outside the Crime Laboratory is a group of anti-drugs citizens shouting for justice and conviction against the accused daughter of the city mayor. If you are Dr. Nicole, what will you do?​</a>

How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</a>

The letter is about his son, who wanted to go to school. He was hoping that the landlord, who he considered as compadre, will agree to accept his son as a boarder in order to attend school. They were very poor and the circumstances are against him. As he writes the letter, he looks at his child. The smells of poverty assail the father’s nostrils as he scratches out word after word, trying to look for the right words. He eventually remembers how the landlord, albeit generous with the rice, demanded twice its value at payback time. This gives him mixed emotions as he struggles with memories and tries to express himself for the sake of his son. He eventually finished the letter and asked the worker to deliver it to the landlord. The son was ery curious about the contents of this letter, and he finds a way to read the letter undetected. As he read the letter and realized what his father did to ensure his future, he feels a glow in his heart, and soon realizes that he is indeed, the happiest boy in the world.

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</h2><br />

One time her boyfriend Mark who is the judge of the Regional Trial Court of Calamba was assassinated by the unknown armed men. One evening, she received a call from her friend saying that she has to meet her old client and friend. Upon coming to her office, she received her former client and friend Zandy. Zandy confessed that she is the one who commanded the assassins to assail the judge. Unknown to Zandy is the relationship between the celebrity lawyer and the deceased judge. However, before they talked, both signed an agreement that says that what shall transpire in their conversation shall be considered as privileged communication. Zandy asked Atty. Nathalie to be her legal counsel. Atty. Nathalie Joy and her deceased fiancé highly believe in the sanctity of the legal profession. If you are Atty. Nathalie Joy, what will you do?2. Victoria, the mother of Rico, is known to be a church servant in their Local Church. One night while she was preparing for diner, suddenly, her son came rushing to her. This son of hers confessed that her girlfriend Gayle was found pregnant. Her girlfriend, being a minor, told her parents that she was just simply seduced by her boyfriend that is why they ended up with a child in her womb. Frederico, the father of Gayle and a military sergeant, becomes furious and hunts the lover of his daughter to harm the latter. Afraid of the father of Gayle, Aling Victoria brought his son to Pastor Denggoy, the eldest brother of Vicoria, to seek refuge for his son. It so happened that the said pastor and Frederico are “compadres” because the former is one of the godfathers of Gayle in her baptism. If you are Pastor Denggoy, what will you do? 3. During a buy-bust operation conducted by the PNP San Gabriel City, the daughter of the incumbent city mayor, Chenelyn, was accosted by the policemen in pot – session. There is a strong public belief that Chenelyn is behind the rampant drug activities in his town. During the preliminary investigation, Dr. Nicole, the resident criminal laboratory doctor is given the task of conducting a drug test to the accosted daughter of the city mayor. Dr. Nicole is known for her credibility for her profession and is even recognized by the United Nations as one of the excellent practitioners in her field. In the afternoon before she would conduct the drug test for the accused, she received a call from her mother, who was a victim of a drugrelated crime, saying that she must perform the drug test well. After a few minutes, the city mayor himself shows up and offers 1.5 million pesos surety just to falsify her soon to be findings. The mayor indirectly conveyed that if she does anything against his will, evil may befall on Dr. Nicole’s family. Outside the Crime Laboratory is a group of anti-drugs citizens shouting for justice and conviction against the accused daughter of the city mayor. If you are Dr. Nicole, what will you do?​</h2><br />

                        Answer<p>Religious leaders in a community can act as a mediator in reconciling two parties in conflict. This is also called Mediation and Reconciliation. Meaning, putting the two arguing parties into an agreement without violence. </p><p>As Pastor Dino, the first thing you can do is prevent Frederico from committing a Crime like battery and assault. It will become much worse for Frederico, Gayle, and her child if the Boy dies. Frederico may face charges of assault and battery. Meanwhile, Gayle and her child would become fatherless.

How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</h2><br />

                        SITUATION AND EXAMPLE SOLUTIONS1. MARGIE'S DILEMMA<p>a.<strong> Priests or spiritual leaders are mediators.</strong> So, as a pastor, I should invite all parties involved to put up a discussion inside the parish church. In this way, violence can be avoided. Or if emotional distress rush up, Pastor Fred can deescalate the situation.</p><p></p><p>b. My choice would be classified as<strong> intellectual </strong>because the situation is highly-charged emotionally. So, there must be a compass of logic to it before they do something they regret. </p><p></p><p>c. The cost of my decision my cause some people to resent me because it's a family matter. Most family matters must be handled by their own and outsiders are often unwelcome. I might be <strong>subjected to insults</strong> or verbal abuses. </p><p></p>2. DR. HEART-- INTEGRITY OR FEAR?<p>a. There is certainly fear with this and with that she is going against a powerful person. Dr. Heart should accept the offer and falsify the drug test. <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, she should keep the original results and keep a record of the threats and bribing directly from anyone connected to the mayor. If the mayor himself showed up, she should record the conversation and transaction privately. She can keep the money but she has to wait and secure her family before revealing the truth. </p><p></p><p>b.<strong> Practical.</strong> Being heroic and having integrity is good but it will murder you or anyone you are close with. To guard your safety and other's safety, good morals should be delayed first. </p><p></p><p><strong>c. The cost of my decision will be my career.</strong> As a health practitioner, accepting bribes and falsification of data are frowned upon. There might be trust issues about my actions but there are no choices. </p><p></p><p><strong>DILEMMA</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10489620</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

The letter is about his son, who wanted to go to school. He was hoping that the landlord, who he considered as compadre, will agree to accept his son as a boarder in order to attend school. They were very poor and the circumstances are against him. As he writes the letter, he looks at his child. The smells of poverty assail the father’s nostrils as he scratches out word after word, trying to look for the right words. He eventually remembers how the landlord, albeit generous with the rice, demanded twice its value at payback time. This gives him mixed emotions as he struggles with memories and tries to express himself for the sake of his son. He eventually finished the letter and asked the worker to deliver it to the landlord. The son was ery curious about the contents of this letter, and he finds a way to read the letter undetected. As he read the letter and realized what his father did to ensure his future, he feels a glow in his heart, and soon realizes that he is indeed, the happiest boy in the world.

                            24. They had moved here to the island of Mindoro about a year ago because Julio had been unable to find any land of his own to farm. As it was, he thought himself lucky when Ka Ponso agreed to take him on as a tenant. “Dear Compadre,” he started writing. A while before, his wife had given birth to a baby. Ka Ponso had happened to be in the neighborhood and offered to be the baby’s godfather. After that they had begun to call each other compadre. Julio was writing in Tagalog, bending earnestly over a piece of paper torn out of his son’s school notebook. It was many months since he had had a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the municipal office in Mansalay to file a homestead application. Then he had used a pen and, to his surprise, he had been able to fill in the blank form neatly. Nothing had come of the application, although Ka Ponso had assured him he had looked into the matter and talked with the officials concerned. Now, using a pencil instead of a pen, Julio was sure he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso. Answer the following questions based on the text. 1. Who had moved to the island of Mindoro? 2. Why did they move to the island? 3. How did Ka Ponso help him? 4. How are Ka Ponso and Julio related to each other? 5. What was it that Julio was happy about? 6. What positive characteristics did Julio show in the story? Did you admire him for that? Why, explain your answer.</h2><br />
