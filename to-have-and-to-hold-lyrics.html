José Garcia Villa - 1908-199
First, a poem must be magical,
Then musical as a sea-gull.
It must be a brightness moving
And hold secret a bird’s flowering.
It must be slender as a bell,
And it must hold fire as well.
It must have the wisdom of bows
And it must kneel like a rose.
It must be able to hear
The luminance of dove and deer.
It must be able to hide
What it seeks, like a bride.
And over all I would like to hover
God, smiling from the poem’s cover.

1. I have died everyday              waiting for you
Darling don’t be afraid; I have loved you
For a thousand years, I’ll love you for a thousand more.
2. I have two hands, the left and the right Hold them up high, so clean, and bright 
Clap them softly, One, two, three
3. Shot me out of the sky, you are my kryptonite You keep making me weak
Frozen and can’t breathe
4. Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down
5. Like a small boat On the ocean Sending big waves into motion

First, a poem must be magical, Then musical as a sea-gull. 
It must be a brightness moving 
And hold secret a bird’s flowering. It must be slender as a bell, 
And it must hold fire as well. 
It must have the wisdom of bows And it must kneel like a rose. 
It must be able to hear 
The luminance of dove and deer. 
It must be able to hide 
What it seeks, like a bride. 
And over all I would like to hover God, smiling from the poem’s cover. </a>

If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow 'Cause you forgot yesterday I gave you my love to borrow But you just gave it away You can't expect me to be fine I don't expect you to care I know I've said it before But all of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time When we called it love But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this And all those fairy tales are full of s One more f love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone Man, f that s I'll be out spending all this money While you sitting 'round wondering Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing Made it from the bottom Now, when you see me I'm stunning And all of my cars start with a push of a button Telling me had chances I blew up Or whatever you call it Switch the number to my phone So you never could call it Don't need my name on my show You can tell that I'm balling Swish, what a shame could have got picked Had a really good game But you missed your last shot So you talk about who you see at the top Or what you could have saw But sad to say it's over for Phantom pulled up valet open doors Wished I'd go away Got what you was looking for Now it's me who they want So you can go and take that Little piece of s with you I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two? If "Happy Ever After" did exist I would still be holding you like this All these fairy tales are full of s Yeah, one more f love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone ​</a>

Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't forget me, " I beg I remember you said "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't forget me, " I begged I remember you said "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" Nothing compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you "Don't forget me, " I beg I remember you said "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't forget me, " I begged I remember you said "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead" T-T​</a>

José Garcia Villa - 1908-199
First, a poem must be magical,
Then musical as a sea-gull.
It must be a brightness moving
And hold secret a bird’s flowering.
It must be slender as a bell,
And it must hold fire as well.
It must have the wisdom of bows
And it must kneel like a rose.
It must be able to hear
The luminance of dove and deer.
It must be able to hide
What it seeks, like a bride.
And over all I would like to hover
God, smiling from the poem’s cover.

                            12. First a Poem Must Be Magical(Lyric 17)Jose Garcia VillaFirst, a poem must be magical,Then musical as a seagullIt must be a brightness movingAnd hold secret a bird's flowering.It must be slender as a bell,And it must hold fire as well.It must have the wisdom of bowsAnd it must kneel like a rase,It must be able to hearThe luminance of a dove and deer.It must be able to hideWhat it seeks, like a bride.And over all I would like to hoverGod, smiling from the poem's cover.Process Questions:2.How do you define a poem​</h2><br />
                        <p>You define it as a short chapter in which everything is rhyming, deeper words are used when making one, making it look like you have expressed more than you do, Poems are rather a chapter of our story or a whole book in just stanzas.</p><p></p><br />

Frozen and can’t breathe

Jack fell down

First, a poem must be magical, Then musical as a sea-gull. 
It must be a brightness moving 
And hold secret a bird’s flowering. It must be slender as a bell, 
And it must hold fire as well. 
It must have the wisdom of bows And it must kneel like a rose. 
It must be able to hear 
The luminance of dove and deer. 
It must be able to hide 
What it seeks, like a bride. 
And over all I would like to hover God, smiling from the poem’s cover. </h2><br />
