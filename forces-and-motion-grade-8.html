It also stated that with the same force, heavierobjects have smaller acceleration, thus, Net force=mass x acceleration or Fnet = ma.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong>There are many examples of forces in our everyday lives: weight force (i.e. the weight of something) the force of a bat on the ball. the force of the hair brush on hair when it is being brushed.</p><p>•gravitational force</p><p>•magnetic force </p><p>•elextrical force</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong>Contact force occurs due to the contact between two different objects. Non-contact force occurs due to either attraction or repulsion between two objects such that there is no contact between these objects. ... The frictional force is an example of a contact force. Gravitational force is an example of a non-contact force.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong>Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong>The strength of the gravitational force between two objects depends on two factors, mass and distance. the force of gravity the masses exert on each other. If one of the masses is doubled, the force of gravity between the objects is doubled. increases, the force of gravity decreases.</p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong>Objects with more mass have more gravity. Gravity also gets weaker with distance. So, the closer objects are to each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is. Earth's gravity comes from all its mass.</p><p></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong>The <strong>mass</strong> of an object is a measure of the object's inertial property, or the amount of matter it contains. The <strong>weight</strong> of an object is a measure of the force exerted on the object by gravity, or the force needed to support it.</p><p></p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong>Since gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance between the two interacting objects, more separation distance will result in weaker gravitational forces.</p><p></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong>In other words, the coefficient does not change according to the surface area of contact. Since the equation does not specify a direction for the frictional force, it must be stated and understood that the frictional force always acts in the opposite direction as the force applied to the object.</p><p></p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong>By polishing the surface, as polishing makes the surface smooth and friction can be reduced. Using lubricants such as oil or grease can reduce the friction between the surfaces. When objects are rolled over the surface, the friction between the rolled object and surface can be reduced by using ball bearings.</p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Friction is a force that resists the motion of two surfaces that are touching. There are several types of friction. Static friction prevents surfaces from sliding past each other. ... Up to a limit, the strength of static friction changes to match the applied force.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong>Causes of Friction: Friction is a force that resists the relative motion between two objects or materials. The causes of this resistive force are molecular adhesion, surface roughness, and deformations. Adhesion is the molecular force resulting when two materials are brought into close contact with each other.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>paheart naman po atpa brainliest❤❤❤</p><br />
