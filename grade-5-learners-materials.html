                                            Let's Explore This Suggested Time Allotment: 20 Minutes Activity 1: Directions: The following situations depict some work values. Choose two (2) situations and read them carefully. Write your insights on a clean sheet of paper. And answer the processing questions thereafter. Situation 1 The teacher asked her learners to bring materials for the slogan making contest. This will be their output for the end of 2nd quarter. Owen brought his own materials, the same with Brett and Rozlin. But Aiza forgot to bring hers. She decided to borrow materials from Nicole. Willingly, Nicole and Brett lent their materials to her. Not only they wrote the slogan but also added colorful designs and artworks to make it more appealing to the eyes. The teacher marked their works with "Very Good". Situation 2 There will be a Science Quiz Bee for the Grade 10. The adviser asked her five (5) learners to join. Donna and Laurice invited their co-participants in their class to conduct group review so that they will be prepared for the event. Everyone participated and did their best during the contest. Donna won first place followed by Laurice. Situation 3 Due to the lack of classrooms, learners are congested in their class. To resolve the problem, the principal divided the class into 2. Half the class will have their session in the morning as early as 6 o'clock and the other half in the afternoon. Yannah lived far from the school. She finds it difficult to meet the call time aside from the fact that she is also selling vegetables in the market after school. So, she wakes up early every morning so as not to miss classes and adjust her schedule to attend her work. At night, she still manages to do her homework so that she can be ready in class the next day. Situation 4 Learners were instructed to choose their field of specialization in their Technology Livelihood Education (TLE) class. Rona, Joselie, and Mavic enrolled in an electrical installation course while Efren, Enrique, and Floro decided to register in dressmaking class. Their teacher accepted these learners and treated them equally.​</a>

                                            INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                            22. Let's Explore This Suggested Time Allotment: 20 Minutes Activity 1: Directions: The following situations depict some work values. Choose two (2) situations and read them carefully. Write your insights on a clean sheet of paper. And answer the processing questions thereafter. Situation 1 The teacher asked her learners to bring materials for the slogan making contest. This will be their output for the end of 2nd quarter. Owen brought his own materials, the same with Brett and Rozlin. But Aiza forgot to bring hers. She decided to borrow materials from Nicole. Willingly, Nicole and Brett lent their materials to her. Not only they wrote the slogan but also added colorful designs and artworks to make it more appealing to the eyes. The teacher marked their works with "Very Good". Situation 2 There will be a Science Quiz Bee for the Grade 10. The adviser asked her five (5) learners to join. Donna and Laurice invited their co-participants in their class to conduct group review so that they will be prepared for the event. Everyone participated and did their best during the contest. Donna won first place followed by Laurice. Situation 3 Due to the lack of classrooms, learners are congested in their class. To resolve the problem, the principal divided the class into 2. Half the class will have their session in the morning as early as 6 o'clock and the other half in the afternoon. Yannah lived far from the school. She finds it difficult to meet the call time aside from the fact that she is also selling vegetables in the market after school. So, she wakes up early every morning so as not to miss classes and adjust her schedule to attend her work. At night, she still manages to do her homework so that she can be ready in class the next day. Situation 4 Learners were instructed to choose their field of specialization in their Technology Livelihood Education (TLE) class. Rona, Joselie, and Mavic enrolled in an electrical installation course while Efren, Enrique, and Floro decided to register in dressmaking class. Their teacher accepted these learners and treated them equally.​</h2><br />

                            23. INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.
