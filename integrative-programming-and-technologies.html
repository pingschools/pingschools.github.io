                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                            4. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.
