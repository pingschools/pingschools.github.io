                        <p>From the play, "Death of A Salesman" by Arthur Miller, we see Biff, the eldest son of Willy always trying to impress his father. But unlike his own dad, he is able to see his own flaws and is self-aware of his values, especially the value of truth. I was indeed difficult for Biff to tell his dad the truth because of the fear that he will be hated by his dad. Happy on the other hand, tried to stop his brother because of the fact that throughout the play, he seem to have kind of like to honor their father in his simple ways.</p><br />

                        <p>Biff and Happy were the two sons of Willy Loman. The way he treated his children was so different. Nevertheless, he had a very weird relationship with his sons.
</p><p>
</p><p>How they treated their dad:
</p><p>
</p><p>Biff, the older son, was the favored child. However, their relationship as son and father was dysfunctional.  At first, Willy was honing Biff to be the wonder child he could be proud of. <strong>Biff once admired his father, but  the time when Biff found out about his father's affair with another woman, he became disappointed and realized that his father was a liar.</strong> After this, they seemed to have fallen apart. <strong>No respect existed in Biff's vocabulary.</strong> Regardless of that, before Willy's suicide, he still cared about what Biff would think.  </p><p>
</p><p>Happy was the less favored son. Regardless of how his father treated him, <strong>he still made him proud in his own context </strong>(with lies and pretend realities). He loved his father and he wanted to fulfill his dreams for him. <strong>He looked up to him</strong>, and even said during his funeral that his death would not be in vain.  </p><p>
