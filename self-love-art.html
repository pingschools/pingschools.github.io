                                            Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</a>

                            15. Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</h2><br />

                        Western MovementCBCCDNeoclassicism<p>Neoclassicism was a Western cultural movement that took influence from classical antiquity's art and culture in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theater, music, and architecture. In the arts, neoclassicism is an aesthetic attitude based on antiquity's art from Greece and Rome, which evokes harmony, clarity, restraint, universality, and idealism.</p>Jacques-Louis David <p>Jacques-Louis David was a 19th-century painter who is often regarded as the founder of the <strong>Neoclassical</strong> movement. "The Death of Marat" and "Napoleon Crossing the Alps" are two of his most famous works. When Napoleon became Emperor of France in 1804, he named David his First Painter and commissioned him to paint four enormous paintings to celebrate the empire's opening rituals.</p>Characteristics of Neoclassicism<p>Grandiose scale, geometric simplicity, Greek (particularly Doric) or Roman detail, dramatic use of columns, and a penchant for blank walls characterize <strong>Neoclassical</strong> architecture. The new appreciation for ancient simplicity was a broad reaction to the Rococo style's excesses. The use of straight lines, a smooth paint surface, the depiction of light, the use of limited color, and the clear, crisp definition of forms are also characteristics. Jacques-Louis David's paintings are often regarded as the pinnacle of Neoclassical painting.</p><p>What are the characteristics of the neoclassical period?? https://brainly.ph/question/2556758</p>Oath of the Horatii<p>is a big painting by Jacques-Louis David, which was completed in 1784 and is presently on exhibit at the Louvre in Paris. The painting was an instant hit with critics and the general public, and it is today one of the most well-known <strong>Neoclassical</strong> works. It's a true neoclassical statement, rejecting the tumultuous aesthetics of the day in favor of simplicity and manly coldness.</p>The moral message of the neoclassical painting <p>Neoclassical painters used somber colors with occasional brilliant highlights to depict subjects from Classical literature and history, as used in earlier Greek and Republican Roman art, to convey moral narratives of self-denial and self-sacrifice fully in keeping with the supposed ethical superiority of Antiquity.</p><p></p><p>The description of the Napoleon crossing the alps in neo-classical https://brainly.ph/question/2462111</p><p>what do you think are the differences of artwork created by Jacques-louis David and theodore rousseau?​ https://brainly.ph/question/12625165</p><p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><br />
