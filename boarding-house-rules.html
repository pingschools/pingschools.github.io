                                            LEARNING ACTIVITY SHEET 2.5 Boarding House Analogy Directions: Imagine you are the landlord of a very strange boarding house. Your job is to fill the rooms in the building in the most efficient way possible. The rules you have to follow are as strange as the building because quantum mechanics is not like anything you might have expected. State what electron rule is being applied in the situations stated on the left side of the table. Explain each rule. (This activity is adapted from birdvilleschoosi.net). Boarding House Rules Electron Rules From the Bottom Up: Rooms should be filled from the ground floor and up. Fill up first the rooms on the first floor before starting to put new tenants on the second floor. Singles First, the owner of the building wants to have the renters spread out as much as possible. For that reason, singles are placed first in rooms before couples. If couples must be placed into a room then all of the other rooms on that floor must already have a single in them, Opposite Gender Only: When two people are to be situated in a room, they must be of opposite genders. No men may stay together, and no women may room together. This is an arbitrary rule on the part of the owners: in a just world, we wouldn't have to follow it, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with society's norm.​</a>

But whenhe grew very old, he became very feeble. "Every time he ate, he always broke a plate,because his hands trembled so. 5 The old man's awkwardness soon made his sonangry, and one day he made a wooden plate.When the grandson noticed what his father had done, he took some tools andwent down under the house. There he took a piece of board and began to carve it.When his father saw this, he said to him, "What are you doing, son?" the boy repliedto him, "Father, I am making wooden plates for you and my mother when you areold."'As the son uttered these words, tears gushed from the father's eyes. 10From thetime on, the old man was always allowed to eat at the table with the rest of the family,nor was he made to eat from a wooden plate.1.

                                            Caring can affect you both physically and emotionally, so it is important to recognise your limitations and seek help when you need it. This is important for both you and the person you care for because with the right support you will be able to carry out your role of carer for as long as you need to.The role of carer comes with many rewards but can also have many frustrating and tiring aspects, particularly if your relative or friend needs a lot of support or their needs increase.Whether you have been a carer for years or are new to looking after someone, you need to look after yourself as well.Cthulhu, fictional entity created by fantasy-horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and introduced in his story “The Call of Cthulhu,” first published in the magazine Weird Tales in 1928. The creature is described as “a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.” It is said to be so terrible to behold that it destroys the sanity of those who see it.Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft and first introduced in the short story "The Call of Cthulhu",[2] published in the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, the creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in shape like an octopus, a dragon, and a caricature of human form. Its name was given to the Lovecraft-inspired universe where it and its fellow entities existed, the Cthulhu Mythos.Cthulhu is characterized as the priest or leader of the Old Ones, a species that came to Earth from the stars before human life arose. The Old Ones went dormant, and their city slipped under Earth’s crust beneath the Pacific Ocean. They communicated with humans by telepathy, and, in hidden corners of the world, uncivilized people remembered and worshipped Cthulhu in rites described as loathsome. These groups had statues of Cthulhu that seemed to be made of materials not found on Earth and chanted the phrase “Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn” (“In his house at R’lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming”). When conditions are right, the city will rise, and, with the help of the eternal Cthulhu cult, Cthulhu will awaken and again rule the world.Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same universe inhabited by Cthulhu, among them “The Nameless City” as well as the novella The Whisperer in the Darkness. Though Lovecraft did not live long enough to see the success of his work, in the decades following his death other authors began writing stories about the Cthulhu Mythos. They included Robert Bloch, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Alan Moore. By the turn of the 21st century the Cthulhu Mythos had become a cultural phenomenon. In addition to metafiction, the mythos inspired music (much of it instrumental), horror movies, and, perhaps most notably, games, including board games, card games, tabletop role-playing games, and video and online games.QUESTION:Frank sinatra to be able to carry out the biggest population?​</a>

                            2. LEARNING ACTIVITY SHEET 2.5 Boarding House Analogy Directions: Imagine you are the landlord of a very strange boarding house. Your job is to fill the rooms in the building in the most efficient way possible. The rules you have to follow are as strange as the building because quantum mechanics is not like anything you might have expected. State what electron rule is being applied in the situations stated on the left side of the table. Explain each rule. (This activity is adapted from birdvilleschoosi.net). Boarding House Rules Electron Rules From the Bottom Up: Rooms should be filled from the ground floor and up. Fill up first the rooms on the first floor before starting to put new tenants on the second floor. Singles First, the owner of the building wants to have the renters spread out as much as possible. For that reason, singles are placed first in rooms before couples. If couples must be placed into a room then all of the other rooms on that floor must already have a single in them, Opposite Gender Only: When two people are to be situated in a room, they must be of opposite genders. No men may stay together, and no women may room together. This is an arbitrary rule on the part of the owners: in a just world, we wouldn't have to follow it, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with society's norm.​</h2><br />

But whenhe grew very old, he became very feeble. "Every time he ate, he always broke a plate,because his hands trembled so. 5 The old man's awkwardness soon made his sonangry, and one day he made a wooden plate.When the grandson noticed what his father had done, he took some tools andwent down under the house. There he took a piece of board and began to carve it.When his father saw this, he said to him, "What are you doing, son?" the boy repliedto him, "Father, I am making wooden plates for you and my mother when you areold."'As the son uttered these words, tears gushed from the father's eyes. 10From thetime on, the old man was always allowed to eat at the table with the rest of the family,nor was he made to eat from a wooden plate.1.

                            13. Caring can affect you both physically and emotionally, so it is important to recognise your limitations and seek help when you need it. This is important for both you and the person you care for because with the right support you will be able to carry out your role of carer for as long as you need to.The role of carer comes with many rewards but can also have many frustrating and tiring aspects, particularly if your relative or friend needs a lot of support or their needs increase.Whether you have been a carer for years or are new to looking after someone, you need to look after yourself as well.Cthulhu, fictional entity created by fantasy-horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and introduced in his story “The Call of Cthulhu,” first published in the magazine Weird Tales in 1928. The creature is described as “a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.” It is said to be so terrible to behold that it destroys the sanity of those who see it.Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft and first introduced in the short story "The Call of Cthulhu",[2] published in the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, the creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in shape like an octopus, a dragon, and a caricature of human form. Its name was given to the Lovecraft-inspired universe where it and its fellow entities existed, the Cthulhu Mythos.Cthulhu is characterized as the priest or leader of the Old Ones, a species that came to Earth from the stars before human life arose. The Old Ones went dormant, and their city slipped under Earth’s crust beneath the Pacific Ocean. They communicated with humans by telepathy, and, in hidden corners of the world, uncivilized people remembered and worshipped Cthulhu in rites described as loathsome. These groups had statues of Cthulhu that seemed to be made of materials not found on Earth and chanted the phrase “Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn” (“In his house at R’lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming”). When conditions are right, the city will rise, and, with the help of the eternal Cthulhu cult, Cthulhu will awaken and again rule the world.Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same universe inhabited by Cthulhu, among them “The Nameless City” as well as the novella The Whisperer in the Darkness. Though Lovecraft did not live long enough to see the success of his work, in the decades following his death other authors began writing stories about the Cthulhu Mythos. They included Robert Bloch, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Alan Moore. By the turn of the 21st century the Cthulhu Mythos had become a cultural phenomenon. In addition to metafiction, the mythos inspired music (much of it instrumental), horror movies, and, perhaps most notably, games, including board games, card games, tabletop role-playing games, and video and online games.QUESTION:Frank sinatra to be able to carry out the biggest population?​</h2><br />
