That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

                                            What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</a>

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

                            16. What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

She saw Hare Krishna dancers, preachers who doesn't seem to believe their own claims, conspiracy theorists that made her feel a bit guilty, among other people. She had her lunch at the Rose Garden, and then went to see Rotten Row, which reminded her of Home, back in Zimbabwe. </p><p></p><p>                   Since then, she visited Hyde Park numerous times.

Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</h2><br />
