With each shovel of dirt that hit the donkey's back, the donkey would shake it off and take a step up.
As the farmer and his neighbors continued to throw dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and

                                            n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

People had read and heard of elephants but no one in the town had ever seen one. Thus, a huge crowd gather around the elephant, and it was as occasion for great fun, especially for the children. Flve blind men also lived in that town, and consequently, they also heard about the elephant. They had never seen an elephant before, and they were eager to find out about the elephant. Then someone suggested that the blind men go and feel the elephant with their hands. They could then get an idea of what an elephant looks like. The five blind men went to the center of the town where all the people made room for them to touch the elephant. Later on, they sat down and began to discuss their experiences. One blind man, who had touched the trunk of the elephant, said that the elephant must be like a thick tree branch. Another touched the tall said the elephant probably looked like a snake or rope. The third man, who touched the ear, said that the elephant must be a pillar. The fourth man, who touched the ear, sald that the elephant must be like a huge fan. The fifth, who touched the side, said It must be like a wall. They sat for hours and argued, each one sure that his view, but no one was quite willing to listen to the others. Finally, they decided to go to the wise man of the village and ask him who was correct. The wise man said, “Each one of you is correct and each one of you is wrong because each one of you had only touched a part of the elephant's body. Thus, you only have a partial view of the animal. If you put your partial views together, you will get an idea of what an elephant looks like." This story will help asses your different perspective on the community.

                                            Write True if the statement is correct and False if not.1. Involuntary motion refers to the motion caused by unnatural conditions2. Involuntary motion refers the ability of humans, as well as animals, to move because they have the will or thecapacity to do so3. Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a model that is similar to the model proposed by Aristarchus, with the Sun placedat the center4. The Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations were able to systematically observe the motion of the Sun by usinga sundial called gnomon.5. When a rock is thrown upward it would naturally come down because it must go back to its natural state.6. Diurnal motion refers to the apparent motion of the stars and other celestial bodies around the Earth.7. The study about the motion of objects started with the idea about how the heavenly bodies move.8. The celestial domain views the universe as perfect; hence, the universe can only be made up of the perfectsubstance which was called "ether” and can only move in perfect emotion.9. Galileo further proclaimed that it was natural for heavenly bodies to follow perfect paths through circular motion10. Galileo argued that only when friction is present that a force is needed to keep an object moving.11. Friction is the force that acts between materials which are in contact as they move past each other.12. Newton further deduced that this force decreases as the square of the distance between the centers of the massof the objects increase13. The velocity of an object changes when it changes speed, changes direction, or changes both speed anddirection14. Claudius Ptolemy proposed another model where the whole universe moved about the stationary Earth.15. Newton's first Law of motion happens to be a restatement of Galileo's concept of inertia and how it affectsmotion16. Kepler's laws are empirical laws because they are based on observations and computations of planetarymovements17. Motion is a scalar quantity, refers to the actual length of the path taken by an object when it is moving.18. Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to the rate of distance travelled over time while velocity is a vectorquantity that refers to how fast and in what direction an object is moving, or simply displacement overtime19. Newton's third law explains that forces come in pairs. To put it simply, when three object applies a force onanother object, the other object applies the different amount of force on the first object.20. Galileo's view is a change in velocity means acceleration and that force is applied​</a>

                                            Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                            7. n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                            13. The Elephant and the Blind Men Once upon a time, an elephant came to a small. People had read and heard of elephants but no one in the town had ever seen one. Thus, a huge crowd gather around the elephant, and it was as occasion for great fun, especially for the children. Flve blind men also lived in that town, and consequently, they also heard about the elephant. They had never seen an elephant before, and they were eager to find out about the elephant. Then someone suggested that the blind men go and feel the elephant with their hands. They could then get an idea of what an elephant looks like. The five blind men went to the center of the town where all the people made room for them to touch the elephant. Later on, they sat down and began to discuss their experiences. One blind man, who had touched the trunk of the elephant, said that the elephant must be like a thick tree branch. Another touched the tall said the elephant probably looked like a snake or rope. The third man, who touched the ear, said that the elephant must be a pillar. The fourth man, who touched the ear, sald that the elephant must be like a huge fan. The fifth, who touched the side, said It must be like a wall. They sat for hours and argued, each one sure that his view, but no one was quite willing to listen to the others. Finally, they decided to go to the wise man of the village and ask him who was correct. The wise man said, “Each one of you is correct and each one of you is wrong because each one of you had only touched a part of the elephant's body. Thus, you only have a partial view of the animal.

                            20. Write True if the statement is correct and False if not.1. Involuntary motion refers to the motion caused by unnatural conditions2. Involuntary motion refers the ability of humans, as well as animals, to move because they have the will or thecapacity to do so3. Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a model that is similar to the model proposed by Aristarchus, with the Sun placedat the center4. The Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations were able to systematically observe the motion of the Sun by usinga sundial called gnomon.5. When a rock is thrown upward it would naturally come down because it must go back to its natural state.6. Diurnal motion refers to the apparent motion of the stars and other celestial bodies around the Earth.7. The study about the motion of objects started with the idea about how the heavenly bodies move.8. The celestial domain views the universe as perfect; hence, the universe can only be made up of the perfectsubstance which was called "ether” and can only move in perfect emotion.9. Galileo further proclaimed that it was natural for heavenly bodies to follow perfect paths through circular motion10. Galileo argued that only when friction is present that a force is needed to keep an object moving.11. Friction is the force that acts between materials which are in contact as they move past each other.12. Newton further deduced that this force decreases as the square of the distance between the centers of the massof the objects increase13. The velocity of an object changes when it changes speed, changes direction, or changes both speed anddirection14. Claudius Ptolemy proposed another model where the whole universe moved about the stationary Earth.15. Newton's first Law of motion happens to be a restatement of Galileo's concept of inertia and how it affectsmotion16. Kepler's laws are empirical laws because they are based on observations and computations of planetarymovements17. Motion is a scalar quantity, refers to the actual length of the path taken by an object when it is moving.18. Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to the rate of distance travelled over time while velocity is a vectorquantity that refers to how fast and in what direction an object is moving, or simply displacement overtime19. Newton's third law explains that forces come in pairs. To put it simply, when three object applies a force onanother object, the other object applies the different amount of force on the first object.20. Galileo's view is a change in velocity means acceleration and that force is applied​</h2><br />

                            26. Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”
