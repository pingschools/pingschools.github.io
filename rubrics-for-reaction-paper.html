                                            Jack, the manager of a small bakery, has been told that he is over budget on bakery supplies. To cut expenses, Jack meets with his staff and instruct them to reuse any supplies they can. On the following Monday, the bakery staff decides to reuse the parchment paper used to line the cookie pans during baking. On Friday of the same week, Mrs. Alba calls to tell the bakery that her 7- year old son was hospitalized shortly after eating some sugar cookies that were purchased on Thursday. Mrs. Alba further accuses the bakery of not having correct ingredient label on the sugar cookies. She said her son had a severe allergic reaction to peanuts, which was traced back to the cookies. When Jack learns about the situation, he insists the ingredient label is correct and that peanuts are not in the sugar cookie recipe.   QUESTIONS : •How could the sugar cookies be the cause of Mrs. Smith’s son’s allergic reaction? •How could this situation have been prevented?

Being situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire" makes it Located along the typhoon belt in the Pacific, the Philippines is visited by an average of 20 Punerable to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Its geographical location and physical environment also contribute to its high-susceptibility level rise, storm surges, landslides, flood/flashflood/flooding, and drought. The abovementioned disasters are the reasons why we should always be prepared. Materials: Paper/ Bond Paper Pen Guide: 1. Compare and contrast on the preparedness during disaster; 2. Using inductive and deductive reasoning in an arguments in time of disaster; and 3. Give the importance of safety to avoid hazards in the workplace especially during disaster. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In article one, it shows about the safety tips when there is a typhoon and so does article two about earthquakes. In typhoon safety tips we hide inside the house when there is a typhoon and staying away from glass and other fragile things that can cause us to get cuts. In the earthquake safety tips it tells us to hide under a strong table or desk when inside, while running away from structures when outside.
</p><p>
</p><p>In my experience about the typhoon is not really that risky. It wasn't that bad because it did not create any damage to me, my family, and my surroundings. If there is a typhoon that bad in our place we go inside our rooms and not go close to any windows so we can’t get any glass in our body especially in our eyes that can cause blindness and blurry vision. After that we check the outside if it is safe to go and check other people if they are ok, we then check the news for any updates about the typhoon. Now In my experience about earthquake was not that big of a deal either but was scary since it was midnight. The bed was shaking and my tired self really thought it was a demon trying to take my soul. Every typhoon I experienced was easy, therefore this time it will be easy.If there is an earthquake we first hide under a strong furniture if the earthquake magnitude scale is 5.5 to 6.0. Then after the earthquake we check if there are any injuries or cuts that we got from the earthquake, we make sure to check for it. The particular reason for the circumstance is, it can cause blood loss. In typhoon and earthquakes they both cause damage, both can give us injuries and cuts, both can kill someone.  </p><p>
</p><p>I agree with the articles I’ve read making sure we are safe from any natural danger. I was never prepared for the damage that may cause, now I check the weather news for any upcoming typhoon or possible earthquake that can be reached in our place. Now that I’ve learned about the safety tips I knew how to take care of myself when there is an earthquake or a typhoon.  </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p><strong>If you experienced a bad earthquake and typhoon you can change the reaction paper based on your perspective.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            10. Jack, the manager of a small bakery, has been told that he is over budget on bakery supplies. To cut expenses, Jack meets with his staff and instruct them to reuse any supplies they can. On the following Monday, the bakery staff decides to reuse the parchment paper used to line the cookie pans during baking. On Friday of the same week, Mrs. Alba calls to tell the bakery that her 7- year old son was hospitalized shortly after eating some sugar cookies that were purchased on Thursday. Mrs. Alba further accuses the bakery of not having correct ingredient label on the sugar cookies. She said her son had a severe allergic reaction to peanuts, which was traced back to the cookies. When Jack learns about the situation, he insists the ingredient label is correct and that peanuts are not in the sugar cookie recipe.   QUESTIONS : •How could the sugar cookies be the cause of Mrs. Smith’s son’s allergic reaction? •How could this situation have been prevented?

Ang pagdiriwang ng EDSA Revolution Peoples Power ay hindi lamang isang pag-alala sa ating kasaysayan, ito rin ay paalala sa atin na tayo ay may kakayahan na baguhin ang kasaysayan at magtulungan upang makamit ang tunay na pagbabago sa ating bansa.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:1.) Obama addressed the subjects of racial tensions, white privilege, and race and inequality in the United States, discussing black "anger", white "resentment", and other issues as he sought to explain and contextualize Wright's controversial comments.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2.) As the former president Barack Obama said, "Let's be clear, There are no winners here" as he signed the stop-gap bill. He explained fully the enumerated implementations and its advantages and future benefits. ... But still, some people don't put their trust on Barack Obama's words.

</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4.)He said that the fact is, democracy has never been easy and our Founding Fathers argued about everything. We waged a Civil War. We overcame depression. We’ve lurched from eras of great progressive change to periods of retrenchment.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>5.) The statement of obama is sound and logical.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>6.) the readers' emotions; name calling is an invalid argument that deviates from a certain topic and attacks the person; and, appeal to authority uses authoritative support to win an argument.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>7.) For me yup. because I understand Obama’s speech he wants all people to be equal for everyone no matter what kind of color everyone has. And regardless of the status of different people, for Obama everyone has equal rights

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>The Spoliarium (often misspelled Spolarium) is a painting by Filipino painter Juan Luna. The painting was submitted by Juan Luna to the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1884 in Madrid, where it garnered the first gold medal (out of three). Juan Luna gained great popularity among the Filipinos because of this painting.</strong><p></p><strong>Well, the first thing we'll notice about the painting is its size itself. Standing at 4.22 meters in height and 7.675 m in width (to be precised),</strong><strong>no doubt that the painting commands attention and gives off a majestic aura. It is the largest painting in the Philippines so far. Any viewer of the painting will feel dwarfed by the large painting and may feel overwhelmed by the magnanimity of it. The next thing we'll notice about the painting is the rich in colors used. Mostly, the painter made use of warm colors for his work of art, with reds being a central color that attracts the most attention. As what other's personal experience, the colors are striking and quite unique.</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p>pa brainliest po</p><br />
