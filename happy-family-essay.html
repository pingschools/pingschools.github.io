These include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, infections, miscarriage and stillbirth.</p><p></p><p>According to studies, women who bear more than 4 children are at increased risk for maternal mortality, so they need to plan accordingly. Women who get pregnant after the age of 35 are vulnerable to health risks, so they should be protected through careful planning as well.</p><p></p><p>Also, by reducing unintended pregnancies, family planning also removes the option for unsafe abortion.</p><p></p><p>When a pregnancy is unplanned, ill-timed, or too closely spaced, it affects the mother’s health which, in turn, affects the health and safety of her unborn child. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, an infant will have a greater risk of death and weak health if the mother dies while giving birth.</p><p></p><p>When a couple or an individual is aware of their rights and knows what their options are, they can make sound decisions in life. </p><p></p><p>Family planning can help a couple or an individual decide on what’s best for their sexual and reproductive health. By carefully spacing pregnancies, a couple can build financial security, allowing them to raise a family that they can properly care for. A family that is properly cared for is a healthy family, and a healthy family is the foundation of a healthy community.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>we are of opinion that instead of letting books grow moldy behind in an iron grating far from the vulgar gaze it is better to let them wear out by being read </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope it can help you</p><br />

Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</h2><br />

                        I want my future family to have similar aspects of my current family, such as loving my children as much as my mom does, along with aspects of Gil’s family, like how even when he was stressed, he still stayed and cared for his family. Even as a child, I have always thought I would be a fun mother, and I hope to have a family somewhat of the likes of Gil’s. His children had fun, and, although he was stressed out often times, he found a way to still make time for what matters most: being with his family. I know it will be a little hard to obtain this goal, but I will try my very best to make a loving family who will go out on a limb for you. I believe a family should do anything for you when you need them most and I will shape my children into people I would want to be friends with. In order for me to try to keep qualities like my family now, I would need to work with the parenting styles my parents have shown me through the years.Hope it helps!

My father didn't leave us, but my mother left us,</p><p></p><p>My father traveled to Manila in search of work so that we could eat and finish school.</p><p></p><p>Even though my sister and I were upset that he was going to Manila,</p><p></p><p>But it was also for us why my father went to Manila.</p><p></p><p>and we weren’t always with my dad at Christmas and his birthday.</p><p></p><p>When my parents separated, my grandmother and grandfather took care of us. We are grateful to my grandma and grandpa for taking care of us. They will give their love to us and we love them too.</p><p></p><p>My sister's name is (yn) and she is always an honor at school.</p><p></p><p>My sister is easily angry, but she is kind and cheerful.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes my sister is joking.</p><p></p><p>I'm a naughty and stubborn child, happy and sometimes greedy. When I was 5 or 6 years old, I was honored, but when I was 7 years old, I was not honored in school. I envy my sister sometimes because she always honors me, but I'm still proud of my sister because she always honors me.</p><p></p><p>And now there is a condition that is very hard in our lives, but we don't give up. We just fight because that hardship will also disappear.</p><p><strong>Explanation:<br />Not sure if correct but I tried!</strong></p><br />
