                            16. Learning Objectives: At the end of the lesson, you are able to: a. analyze problems involving measures of position; b. use the appropriate procedure in solving problems involving measures of position and c. appreciates the importance of measures of position in real life situations. In solving a word problem, it is important to analyze it carefully to easily identify the proper solution. Considering problems involving measures of position, the following questions should be answered correctly to come up with the right answer: 1. What is the data being presented in the problem? Is it ungrouped or grouped data? 2. What measure of position is being asked? Is it quartile? decile? percentile? 3. What is the procedure to perform and the formula to use?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.What is grouped data and ungrouped data? Grouped data means the data (or information) given in the form of class intervals such as 0-20, 20-40 and so on. Ungrouped data is defined as the data given as individual points (i.e. values or numbers) such as 15, 63, 34, 20, 25, and so on.</p><p></p><p>2. The quartiles of a data set divide the data into four equal parts, with one-fourth of the data values in each part. The second quartile position is the median of the data set, which divides the data set in half. To find the median position of the data set, divide the total number of data values (n) by 2. If there are an even number of data values, the median is the value that is the average of the value in the position and the + 1 position. (If there are an odd number of data values, the median is the value in the position.) For example, if the data set has 20 values, then the median is the average of the data values in the = 10th and + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11th position. For example, in the data set below, with 20 values, the median is the average of 9 and 11, which is 10.</p><p></p><p>3.To tell Microsoft Excel what type of operation you want to perform in a formula, you use special symbols that are technically called operators</p><p></p><p></p><br />
