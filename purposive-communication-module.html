                                            across channels, contexts, media, and culturunderstand communication, you have to take a closer look to itsyou explore its nature, you will come across the following features:Communication is a PROCESSCommunication is a process in which a source/speaker sends andencodes a message through a channel to a destination/receiver. The receiverdecodes the message in order to give an appropriate feedback. This processis dynamic or always changing as it occurs within a context which constantlyvaries depending on so many factors like the people involved, the place, thechannels used and the situation. Communication also occurs always withnoise which affects the entire process in one way or another. (This is furtherdiscussed in Lesson 3 of this module).Communication occurs between TWO OR MORE PEOPLE (the speakerand the receiver).Since communication is basically an exchange of ideas orinformation, it is two-waythere is a source of the message and adestination. This can be in a form of a face-to-face interaction, a phoneconversation, a group discussion, and even a letter correspondence.Communication can be expressed through written or spoken words(VERBAL), actions (NONVERBAL), or both spoken words and nonverbalactions at the same time.Communication has two kinds: verbal and nonverbal. Verbalcommunication is the kind of communication that uses symbols that haveuniversal meaning for all involved in the process. These symbols are knownas language used in both spoken and written communication. Nonverbalcommunication, on the other hand, is the use of symbols other than language.These symbols could be in the form of gestures, bodily actions, facialexpression, eye behavior and many more. Generally, communication takesplace with the combination of verbal and nonverbal elements as one kindcomplements the other. ching purposes only​</a>

The receiverdecodes the message in order to give an appropriate feedback. This processis dynamic or always changing as it occurs within a context which constantlyvaries depending on so many factors like the people involved, the place, thechannels used and the situation. Communication also occurs always withnoise which affects the entire process in one way or another. (This is furtherdiscussed in Lesson 3 of this module).Communication occurs between TWO OR MORE PEOPLE (the speakerand the receiver).Since communication is basically an exchange of ideas orinformation, it is two-waythere is a source of the message and adestination. This can be in a form of a face-to-face interaction, a phoneconversation, a group discussion, and even a letter correspondence.Communication can be expressed through written or spoken words(VERBAL), actions (NONVERBAL), or both spoken words and nonverbalactions at the same time.Communication has two kinds: verbal and nonverbal. Verbalcommunication is the kind of communication that uses symbols that haveuniversal meaning for all involved in the process. These symbols are knownas language used in both spoken and written communication. Nonverbalcommunication, on the other hand, is the use of symbols other than language.These symbols could be in the form of gestures, bodily actions, facialexpression, eye behavior and many more. Generally, communication takesplace with the combination of verbal and nonverbal elements as one kindcomplements the other. ching purposes only​</h2><br />
