                                            Case Analysis - Module 3 Instructions Instructions Case Analysis: The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is one of the most popular attractions and a Top Zoo for Children Zoo for Children according to Parent’s Magazine. Each year, more than 1.3 million people visits its 71-acre site, which is home to more than 500 animals and 3,000 plant species. Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved? Explain in detail the proposed solution for each stakeholder. In each solution, identify which type of analytics will be applied (descriptive, predictive or prescriptive)        Zoo visitors        Zoo management        Zoo staff services​</a>

                            23. Case Analysis - Module 3 Instructions Instructions Case Analysis: The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is one of the most popular attractions and a Top Zoo for Children Zoo for Children according to Parent’s Magazine. Each year, more than 1.3 million people visits its 71-acre site, which is home to more than 500 animals and 3,000 plant species. Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved? Explain in detail the proposed solution for each stakeholder. In each solution, identify which type of analytics will be applied (descriptive, predictive or prescriptive)        Zoo visitors        Zoo management        Zoo staff services​</h2><br />
