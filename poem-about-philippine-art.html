Sa tradisyong Ilianon sila’y magkakapatid na anak ni Pamulaw. Si Agyu ay may apat na kapatid na babae, ngunit sina Yambungon at Ikawangon lamang ang binanggit sa epiko. Isang araw nagpadala si Agyu sa datung Moro ng siyam na komu-buu-buong pagkit sa pamamagitan nina Kuyasu at Banlak. Nagalit ang datung Moro dahil kakaunti ang pagkit pambayad, kaya’t kanyang ibinalibag ang pagkit kay Kuyasu na tumama sa may ulser. Gumanti si Kuyasu at kanyang sinibat ang datu na tinamaan sa dibdib. Nahulaan ni Agyu na magkakagiyera dahil napatay ang datu. Nagtungo sila sa Ilian at ipinasiya ni Agyu na magtayo ng kuta sa bundok ng Ilian. Ang mga mandirigmang Morong nagdaan sa Ilog Palangi ay dumating at nakita ang kutang ginawa ng mga Ilianon. Nakipaglaban sina Agyu sa mga Moro at halos naubos ang mga kaaway.Pagkatapos ng tagumpay, ipinasya ni Agyu na lumipat sa bayan. Pinili niya ang bundok ng Pinamatun. Hanggang narating nila ang bayang Tigyandang at dito sila sinalakay. Lumaban ang mga tauhan ni Agyu sa pampangin ng look ng Linayagon. Nang sila’y naubusan ng tauhan, ang batang anak ni Agyu na si Tanagyaw ay nagprisintang sasagupa sa mga kaaway. Napatay niyang lahat ang kalaban nang ikaapat na araw. Narating ni Tanagyaw ang bayang Bablayon. Nanghihilakbot ang mga tao rito at nang malaman niyang lulusubin sila ng mga kaaway o mananakop nanlaban at napatay ni Tanagyaw ang mga mananakop. Dahil dito ay ipinakasal ng datu ang kanyang anak kay Tanagyaw.Di nagluwa’t ang bayan ni Agyu ay nanganib din sa mga mananakop na galing sa ibayong dagat. Ang mga lalaki, bata at matanda ay sinabihang lumaban ngunit sila’y natalo. Hinulaan ng propeta ang malagim nilang wakas ngunit sinalungat at pinarusahan siya ni Tanagyaw. Nagbihis siya ng sampung suson makasiyam ang kapal at dinampot ang kanyang sibat at kalasag na hindi nasisira. Nilabanan niya ang mga mananakop sa dalampasigan. Naghambalong ang mga patay, patung-patong, na parang bundok at burol.Itinalaga ni Agyu ang bayan sa kanyang matagumpay na anak na nanirahan doon kasama ang kanyang kaakit-akit na asawa.‹ Mga Epiko ng PilipinasupAlim (Epiko nLearn this Filipino word:mga waláBack to top.Welcome Guest!About PhilippinesArts and Literature(active menu item)Literary Classics: Ibong Adarna, Florante at Laura, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo(active menu item)Ibong Adarna by an unknown author(active menu item)Florante at Laura by Francisco Baltazar(active menu item)Noli Me Tangere by Dr. José Rizal (Berlin; February 21, 1887)(active menu item)El Filibusterismo by Dr. José Rizal (Ghent, 1891)(active menu item)Works by Dr. José Rizal(active menu item)Mga Balagtasan (Poetical Debate)(active menu item)Mga Awit (Songs)(active menu item)Mga Tula (Poems)(active menu item)Mga Dula (Plays)(active menu item)Mga Parabula (Parables)(active menu item)Mga Alamat (Legends)(active menu item)Mga Kuwentong-bayan (Folktales)(active menu item)Mga Epiko (Epics)(active menu item)Mga Mitolohiya (Mythologies)(active menu item)Mga Bugtong (Riddles)(active menu item)Mga Tugmang Tagalog (Tagalog Nursery Rhymes)(active menu item)Sabayang Pagbigkas(active menu item)Mga Pabula (Fables)(active menu item)Mga Salawikaing Filipino (Filipino Proverbs)(active menu item)Directory(active menu item)Embassies and Consulates in the Philippines(active menu item)Newspapers Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Television Networks in the Philippines(active menu item)Magazine Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Colleges and Universities in the Philippines(active menu item)Language(active menu item)Learn the (Filipino) Language “Tagalog” (Free Online)(active menu item)Mga Kawikaang Tagalog (Tagalog Idioms)(active​</a>

Sa tradisyong Ilianon sila’y magkakapatid na anak ni Pamulaw. Si Agyu ay may apat na kapatid na babae, ngunit sina Yambungon at Ikawangon lamang ang binanggit sa epiko. Isang araw nagpadala si Agyu sa datung Moro ng siyam na komu-buu-buong pagkit sa pamamagitan nina Kuyasu at Banlak. Nagalit ang datung Moro dahil kakaunti ang pagkit pambayad, kaya’t kanyang ibinalibag ang pagkit kay Kuyasu na tumama sa may ulser. Gumanti si Kuyasu at kanyang sinibat ang datu na tinamaan sa dibdib. Nahulaan ni Agyu na magkakagiyera dahil napatay ang datu. Nagtungo sila sa Ilian at ipinasiya ni Agyu na magtayo ng kuta sa bundok ng Ilian. Ang mga mandirigmang Morong nagdaan sa Ilog Palangi ay dumating at nakita ang kutang ginawa ng mga Ilianon. Nakipaglaban sina Agyu sa mga Moro at halos naubos ang mga kaaway.Pagkatapos ng tagumpay, ipinasya ni Agyu na lumipat sa bayan. Pinili niya ang bundok ng Pinamatun. Hanggang narating nila ang bayang Tigyandang at dito sila sinalakay. Lumaban ang mga tauhan ni Agyu sa pampangin ng look ng Linayagon. Nang sila’y naubusan ng tauhan, ang batang anak ni Agyu na si Tanagyaw ay nagprisintang sasagupa sa mga kaaway. Napatay niyang lahat ang kalaban nang ikaapat na araw. Narating ni Tanagyaw ang bayang Bablayon. Nanghihilakbot ang mga tao rito at nang malaman niyang lulusubin sila ng mga kaaway o mananakop nanlaban at napatay ni Tanagyaw ang mga mananakop. Dahil dito ay ipinakasal ng datu ang kanyang anak kay Tanagyaw.Di nagluwa’t ang bayan ni Agyu ay nanganib din sa mga mananakop na galing sa ibayong dagat. Ang mga lalaki, bata at matanda ay sinabihang lumaban ngunit sila’y natalo. Hinulaan ng propeta ang malagim nilang wakas ngunit sinalungat at pinarusahan siya ni Tanagyaw. Nagbihis siya ng sampung suson makasiyam ang kapal at dinampot ang kanyang sibat at kalasag na hindi nasisira. Nilabanan niya ang mga mananakop sa dalampasigan. Naghambalong ang mga patay, patung-patong, na parang bundok at burol.Itinalaga ni Agyu ang bayan sa kanyang matagumpay na anak na nanirahan doon kasama ang kanyang kaakit-akit na asawa.‹ Mga Epiko ng PilipinasupAlim (Epiko nLearn this Filipino word:mga waláBack to top.Welcome Guest!About PhilippinesArts and Literature(active menu item)Literary Classics: Ibong Adarna, Florante at Laura, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo(active menu item)Ibong Adarna by an unknown author(active menu item)Florante at Laura by Francisco Baltazar(active menu item)Noli Me Tangere by Dr. José Rizal (Berlin; February 21, 1887)(active menu item)El Filibusterismo by Dr. José Rizal (Ghent, 1891)(active menu item)Works by Dr. José Rizal(active menu item)Mga Balagtasan (Poetical Debate)(active menu item)Mga Awit (Songs)(active menu item)Mga Tula (Poems)(active menu item)Mga Dula (Plays)(active menu item)Mga Parabula (Parables)(active menu item)Mga Alamat (Legends)(active menu item)Mga Kuwentong-bayan (Folktales)(active menu item)Mga Epiko (Epics)(active menu item)Mga Mitolohiya (Mythologies)(active menu item)Mga Bugtong (Riddles)(active menu item)Mga Tugmang Tagalog (Tagalog Nursery Rhymes)(active menu item)Sabayang Pagbigkas(active menu item)Mga Pabula (Fables)(active menu item)Mga Salawikaing Filipino (Filipino Proverbs)(active menu item)Directory(active menu item)Embassies and Consulates in the Philippines(active menu item)Newspapers Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Television Networks in the Philippines(active menu item)Magazine Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Colleges and Universities in the Philippines(active menu item)Language(active menu item)Learn the (Filipino) Language “Tagalog” (Free Online)(active menu item)Mga Kawikaang Tagalog (Tagalog Idioms)(active​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In my honest and personal opinion, I believe that all the agencies, namely National Commission for Culture and the Arts, Cultural Center of the Philippines, National Historical Commission of the Philippines, National Museum, National Library of the Philippines, National Archives of the Philippines and Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino, are all essential and important. These agencies exist and function for the benefit of the country and the Filipino citizens. In order to successfully promote and preserve the arts, culture and history of the Philippines, these agencies must always continue to operate, fulfill their objectives and serve their purpose. Through the aforementioned agencies, appreciation for Philippine culture and arts and awareness of the history and significant events in the development and evolution of the nation are induced. By way of this, community engagement, pride in Filipino cultural heritage and love of country are developed and nurtured. In order to comprehensively implement all the responsibilities and duties of the agencies, they must all cooperate and work with one another. The agencies are all connected and share a common main purpose which is to preserve and promote Philippine culture and arts and ensure a nationwide participation in the part of Filipino citizens. Therefore, I believe that it would be unjustifiable and wrong to remove even one of the aforementioned agencies, because they are all necessary to us and our country.</p><br />
