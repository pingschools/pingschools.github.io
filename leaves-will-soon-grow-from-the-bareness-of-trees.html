"Growth of a Tree" by Meish Goldish I'm a little maple, oh so small, In years ahead, I'll grow so tall! With a lot of water, sun, and air, I will soon be way up there! 1. Deep inside the soil my roots are found, Drinking the water underground. Water from the roots my trunk receives, Then my trunk starts making leaves. 2. As I start to climb in altitude, Leaves on my branches will make food. Soon my trunk and branches will grow wide, And I'll grow more bark outside! 3. I will be a maple very tall, Losing my leaves when it is fall. But when it is spring, new leaves will show.​</a>

Ben&amp;Ben
I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light
I never thought that you would be the one
I couldn't really justify
How you even thought it could be right
Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end, can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
Try as hard as I might
To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you?
And in the end, everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long
As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
I never thought that I would see the day
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
But in the end what makes it worth the fights
That no matter what happens we try to make it right
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Wounds of the past will eventually heal
And all will be alright in time
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real
I said all will be alright in time
I said all will be alright in time
I said all will be alright in time
All will be alright in time
Oh, you never really love someone until
You learn to forgive
You learn to forgive
Learn to forgive</a>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ty sa pi sa ma kat lytong hehe</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Due to the high winds and heavy snows on tall mountains, most mountain plants are very supple and have the ability to bend a lot before breaking, and any woody plants are stubby and low like the Krummholz mentioned earlier. Firs and Pines. Evergreens are great for hilly and sloping portions of your landscape. These hardy trees hold the soil well, so they can prevent the erosion that might otherwise have taken place. A Douglas fir is always a great choice for hills and sloping areas of your yard. Typical conifers in these mountain regions are pines (Pinus), firs (Abies), spruces (Picea), and the deciduous larches (Larix). Some areas have broad-leaved deciduous trees, and a variety of smaller plants are found beneath the trees, especially in moister spots.</p><p></p><p>#Pabrainliest</p><br />

                         Analyze the song entitled "Leaves" by Ben and Ben<p></p><p><strong>How can you appreciate the poem as you listen to it?</strong></p><p>- <strong>The beat of the poem even without music is easy to follow</strong>, and when arranged musically, it is very pleasing to the ears and can definitely stick in one's head. Apart from semantic value, the poem also imparts a beautiful lesson and sticks to the metaphors for healing, making the whole cohesive.</p><p></p><p><strong>What thoughts, ideas or feelings of the poet can you infer from the poem?</strong></p><p>- The poet can be inferred as a hopeful person trying to look at tomorrow as a time for healed wounds. <strong>He made many mistakes, but someone was always </strong>there to encourage him. Throughout the end of the song, it was his turn to encourage the person with him to keep holding on ("I said everything will be alright in time"). There is deep sadness and pain within the poet, but there is an undeniable seed of hope that tomorrow is another day, and that, just as leaves grow from the empty branches of trees, new life will stem from the dead memories of the past.</p><p></p><p><strong>What emotions or thoughts run through your mind as you listen to this poem?</strong></p><p>- Listening to this song, with the way each line is dropped, I come to share the poet's point of view. They are wounded and imperfect and need to see the bright side no matter how difficult it is. <strong>Eventually, though, it feels less like I am the poet, and more like the poet</strong> is speaking to me--as the song nears the end, the seed of hope is planted in the person the poet is speaking to. It's a heartwarming poem that serves as a reminder that wounds heal if you give it time. "Learning to forgive," then, isn't just about forgiving those who've wronged you--it's also about forgiving yourself, and moving on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>More about the song called "Leaf" by Ben and Ben</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8604391</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                            13. Leaves
Ben&amp;Ben
I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light
I never thought that you would be the one
I couldn't really justify
How you even thought it could be right
Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end, can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
Try as hard as I might
To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you?
And in the end, everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long
As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
I never thought that I would see the day
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
But in the end what makes it worth the fights
That no matter what happens we try to make it right
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Wounds of the past will eventually heal
And all will be alright in time
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real
I said all will be alright in time
I said all will be alright in time
I said all will be alright in time
All will be alright in time
Oh, you never really love someone until
You learn to forgive
You learn to forgive
Learn to forgive</h2><br />
