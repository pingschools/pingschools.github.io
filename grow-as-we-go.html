I don't wanna waste what's left
The storms we chase are leadin' us
And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
No, I don't wanna waste what's left

And on and on we'll go
On we'll go

Finding life along the way
Melodies we haven't played
No, I don't want no rest
Echoin' around these walls
Fighting to create a song (yeah)

Through the wastelands, through the highways
'Til my shadow turns to sunrays
And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
And on and on we'll go
And we'll grow in number
Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
Turn us to thousands
And we'll grow in number
Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
Turn us to thousands

And on and on we'll go
Through the wastelands, through the highways
'Til my shadow turns to sunrays

Grow Foods, on the other hand, allow our bodies to build muscles and fats and repair tissues. Eggs and meat are good examples in this type.

In life, there are people that will hurt us and cause us pain, but we must learn to forgive and forget and not hold grudges.
In life, there are imperfections we will make, but we must learn from our mistakes and grow from them.
In life, there are regrets we will have to live with, but we must learn to leave the past behind and realize it is something we can't change.
In life, there are people we will lose forever and can't have back, but we must learn to let go and move on.
In life, there are obstacles that will cause interference, but we must learn to overcome these challenges and grow stronger.
In life, there are fears that will hold us back from what we want, but we must learn to fight them with the courage from within.
God holds our lives in his hands. He holds the key to our future. Only he knows our fate.
He sees everything and knows everything. Everything in life really does happen for a reason: "God's Reason".</a>

                                            Paragraph 2. Storytelling is an important activity. It can be entertaining and educational at the same time. We tell our younger siblings some stories to help them go to sleep. We tell stories to our friends and family when we get together. We also use stories to teach valuable lessons in life. We use stories to make sense of our world and to share that understanding with others (Rose, 2011). We may not notice it, but the stories we heard while we are growing up had a huge impact on who we are and what we believe in. MAIN IDEA SUPPORTING DETAILS A. B. C.​</a>

                            22. Foods can be classified into three groups based on how they function in the body. These are “Go Foods, Grow Foods, and Glow Foods.” Go Foods provide our body with energy so we can move and work. An example of this is rice. Grow Foods, on the other hand, allow our bodies to build muscles and fats and repair tissues. Eggs and meat are good examples in this type. The third type, Glow Foods, help protect the body against diseases and keep it health. Fruits and vegetables, which are rich in nutrients, belong to Glow Foods. pa answer po plss​</h2><br />

                            29. Choose one line from this poem and explain it to your understanding.
In life, there are people that will hurt us and cause us pain, but we must learn to forgive and forget and not hold grudges.
In life, there are imperfections we will make, but we must learn from our mistakes and grow from them.
In life, there are regrets we will have to live with, but we must learn to leave the past behind and realize it is something we can't change.
In life, there are people we will lose forever and can't have back, but we must learn to let go and move on.
In life, there are obstacles that will cause interference, but we must learn to overcome these challenges and grow stronger.
In life, there are fears that will hold us back from what we want, but we must learn to fight them with the courage from within.
God holds our lives in his hands. He holds the key to our future. Only he knows our fate.
He sees everything and knows everything. Everything in life really does happen for a reason: "God's Reason".</h2><br />

                            30. Paragraph 2. Storytelling is an important activity. It can be entertaining and educational at the same time. We tell our younger siblings some stories to help them go to sleep. We tell stories to our friends and family when we get together. We also use stories to teach valuable lessons in life. We use stories to make sense of our world and to share that understanding with others (Rose, 2011).
