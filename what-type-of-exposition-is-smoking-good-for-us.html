                        <p>Examples of Descriptive Writing. The following sentences provide examples of the concreteness, evocativeness and plausibility of good descriptive writing. Her last smile to me wasn't a sunset. ... The sunset filled the sky with a deep red flame, setting the clouds ablaze.</p>Common Examples of Exposition<br />We often use exposition when we tell friends and family about our days. Exposition has a feeling of “this happened, then this happened, then this,” and so forth. The following sentences, which can be found in everyday language, are examples of exposition:<br /><br />“You know who I’m talking about: Betty, the one who used to work at the library and always wears her hair in a bun.”<br /><br />“My day was terrible. First some guy spilled coffee at me at Starbucks. Then I was late to my meeting and my boss yelled at me. Then I forgot to save my report before closing my computer and lost a full day’s work.”<br /><br />“It was incredible visiting the pyramids in Egypt. They’re just so big and strange against the rest of the landscape. Archaeologists still aren’t completely sure how they were built.”<br /><br />Some forms of writing that we encounter frequently, yet are not literary, are told completely in exposition. For example, newspaper articles, academic papers, and business reports are written almost exclusively in exposition.<br />

The answer, in a word, is addiction.<p></p>Once You Start, It's Hard to Stop<p>Smoking is a hard habit to break because tobacco contains the very addictive chemical nicotine. As with heroin or other addictive drugs, the body and mind quickly get used to the nicotine in cigarettes. Soon, a person needs to have it just to feel normal.</p><p></p><p>People start smoking for different reasons. Some think it looks cool. Others start because their family members or friends smoke. Almost all adult tobacco users started before they were 18 years old. Most never expected to become addicted. That's why it's so much easier to not start smoking at all.</p><p></p>How Can Smoking Affect Health?<p>Many of the chemicals in cigarettes, like nicotine and cyanide, are poisons that can kill in high doses. The body is smart. It goes on the defense when it's being poisoned. First-time smokers often feel pain or burning in their throat and lungs, and some even throw up the first few times they try tobacco.</p><p></p>Over time, smoking leads to health problems such as:<p>•heart disease</p><p>•stroke</p><p>•lung damage</p><p>•many types of cancer — including lung, throat, •stomach, and bladder cancer</p><p></p>Other problems include:<p></p><p>•gum disease</p><p>•yellow teeth</p><p>•eye disease</p><p>•an increased risk for infections (like pneumonia)</p><p>•a greater risk of diabetes</p><p>•weaker bones that are easier to break</p><p>•skin problems like psoriasis (a type of rash)</p><p>•wrinkled skin</p><p>•ulcers</p><p></p><p>Besides these long-term problems, the chemicals in cigarettes and other products also can affect the body quickly. Teen smokers can have many of these problems:</p><p></p><p>•Bad breath. Cigarettes leave smokers with a condition called halitosis, or lasting bad breath.</p><p></p><p>•Bad-smelling clothes and hair. The smell of stale smoke tends to last — not just on people's clothing, but on their hair, furniture, and cars. It's hard to get the smell of smoke out.</p><p></p><p>•Trouble keeping up in sports. Smokers usually can't compete well with nonsmokers. Physical effects of smoking, like a fast heartbeat, decreased circulation, and shortness of breath, harm sports performance.</p><p></p><p>•Greater risk of injury and slower healing time. Smoking hurts the body's ability to make collagen. So common sports injuries, such as damage to tendons and ligaments, will heal more slowly in smokers than nonsmokers.</p><p></p><p>•Increased risk of illness. Studies show that smokers get sick more with colds, flu, bronchitis, and pneumonia than nonsmokers. And people with some health conditions, like asthma, get sicker if they smoke (and often if they're just around people who smoke). Teens who smoke as a way to manage their weight often light up instead of eating. So their bodies can lack the nutrients needed to grow, develop, and fight off illness well.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
