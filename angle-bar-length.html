Itslength can be measured. It is usually named by its two endpoints with a bar above themTo find the measure of the distance between any two points (or length of the line segment), first identify thecoordinates of the points, then find the absolute value of the difference of the coordinates.Ray- a subset of a line with one endpoint and all other points on one side of the endpoint. Since it extends in onedirection infinitely, it cannot be measured. It is named by two points with a ray above them, and with the endpointwritten firstAngle is the result of the union of two rays with a common endpoint. It is measured by means of an instrument, theprotractor, which gives a measure in terms of degrees (º).1​</a>

Do not increase the handle length of pliers to gain more leverage. Use alarger pair of pliers or bolt cutters if necessary.2. Do not substitute pliers for a wrench when turning bolts and nuts. Plierscannot grip these items properly and might cause a slip and create anaccident.3. Use pliers as a hammer on the handle.4. Cut hardened wires only with screwdrivers designed for that purpose.5. Never cut the wires in right angle. Never rock from side to side or bend wireBack and forth against the cutting edges.6. Use screwdrivers as a pry bar, chisel, and punch stirrer or scraper.7. Never use screwdrivers with broken or worn-out handles. Screwdriver ofthese kinds should have tags to indicate that it is defective.8. Never use pliers on a screwdriver for extra leverage. Only use wrench orscrewdrivers specifically designed for purpose.9. Use dull blades because they require more force, thus are more likely toSlip.10. Never leave a knife unattended with the blade exposed.pahelp po need tama ngayon kailangan ko po ng tamang answer please po​</h2><br />

                            23. Learning Task 4: Directions: Identify if the following is a common fault of Pliers, Screwdrivers, or Utility Knives/ Blades 1. Do not substitute pliers for a wrench when furning bolts and nuts. Pliers cannot grip these items property and might cause a slip and create an accident. 2. Don't bend or apply side loads to blades by using them to open cans or loosen fight cover of containers. Blades are brittle and can snap easily. 3. Cut hardened wires only with piliers designed for that purpose. 4. Always cut the wires in right angle. Never rock from side to side or bend wire back and forth against the cutting edges. 5. Never use screwdrivers as a pry bar, chisel, and punch stirrer or scraper. 6. Do not increase the handle length of pliers to gain more leverage. Use a larger pair of pliers or bolt cutters it necessary. 7. Never use screwdrivers with broken or wom-out handles. Screwdrivers of these kinds should have togs to indicate that it is defective. 8. Never use pliers on a screwdriver for extra leverage. Only use wrench or screwdrivers specifically designed for purpose. 9. Do not use dull blades because they require more force, thus are more likely to slip. Replace the blade when it starts to tear" instead of cut. 10.

Then, WRITE the word to make the statement CORRECT. 1. Extension line has arrowheads that show the direction and length of what is being measured. 2. Center lines are used as extension lines. 3. Leader lines should end with a long shoulder preceding the note or dimension. 4. To avoid complicated leaders, dimensions are specified individually. 5. Arrowheads always touch the extension lines. 6. Arrowheads are reversed and placed outside the extension lines when space for the dimension is too wide. 7. The height of the numbers for small drawings is 1 inch. 8. All letters and numerals must be perfectly legible. 9. The numerator and denominator should touch the fraction bar. 10. In aligned system, all dimensional figures and notes are lettered horizontally on the sheet and read from the bottom of the drawing. 11. In dimensioning arcs, move figure and arrowhead outside if the space is limited. 12. Dimension should be placed inside a view. 13. Larger dimensions should be placed outside all intermediate dimensions. 14. An arc serves as dimensions lines for angles. 15. The space between the first-dimension line and the part outline should not be less than 6 millimeters.​</h2><br />
