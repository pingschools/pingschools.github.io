                            23.  Write an essay on how important is the study of Rizal course in this time. What is impact to you as a learner? ​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><strong>The Rizal Course is in the curriculum of subjects. We studied that in our college years. But I personally, Pinoy as I am, and a questioning boy since Grade I, find this Course a surplussage. Rizal could have been a One Chapter in Pinas History. Other than the fact that Rizal’s family can afford to send him to Spain and travel to Europe and wrote two novels and lots of letters (that was the medium thence), and exile in the south of Pinas is far-away Zamboanga, there is not much. There were two novels, but too are other reformers worldwise.</strong><strong>It is important to study the life of Jose Rizal because of his input towards the independence of Philippines. He chose to fight for his country through knowledge and the power of letters. He noticed the continued suffering of his countrymen at the hands of the Spaniards and sought to put an end to this situation.</strong><br />
