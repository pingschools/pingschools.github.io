                                            Let's Elaborate Read the excerpt below and do the activities that follow. What Are Filipinos Like (Excerpt)               Leon Ma. Guerrero Nothing is so difficult as self-appraisal, and to answer the question in the title of this article I thought it best to start by asking it. With no particular pattern in mind, 1 asked a number of foreign friends to give me their impression of the Filipino. I was told that we were friendly, good-natured, loyal, idealistic, sentimental, socially gracious ("even the lower classes"), unwilling to accept responsibility, lacking in self-reliance, less hardworking than the Chinese, more intelligent than the Malays, imitative but less so than the Japanese, religious but not so mystical as the Indians, and, in general, the most adaptable of all the races in the Orient. A Spaniard thought we were very like the Spanish; an American thought we were Dot American enough. A Frenchman remarked we were the only people in Asia with a sense of humor, at least the only ones who could laugh at themselves, which, when one thinks of it, was probably the prettiest compliment of all. By way of contrasts, our fellow Asians had a uniform tendency to laugh at us. A Siamese said we were pretentious. An Indonesian, in much the same yein, deplored our tendency to accept western standards at their face value. A Chinese thought we were zonpresident. An Indian was shocked by the cheapness in which human life was held by a people that could kill for a few centavos, a political argument, or a girl's ruffled feelings. The history of the Philippines might well be read in these national characteristics. There is, to start with, a relatively simple explanation for our notorious lack of self-reliance, which seem to be the main burden of compliment against us these days. For mor than four centuries of colonial rule, we were not allowed to rely on ourselves. Colonialism also suggests the reason for a certain unwillingness to accept responsibility, for too long in our history, it was not accompanied by any real authority.Reflect: How is the Filipino described in the text? What qualities did you like? What about the qualities that you did not  like?All in all, it would not be too far from the truth to say that we owe our faults to others, but our virtues are our own. Colonialism, through its various interpreters, made us irresponsible and imitative, improvident, and even "indolent." It gave us false ideas of the indignity of manual labor and the security of government job. It made us indifferent to our responsibilities to ourselves. Reflect: What assurance does the author give in the last part? If the Filipinos have some negative traits and attitudes, to whom shall these be attributed?​</a>

                                            The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

Guerrero Nothing is so difficult as self-appraisal, and to answer the question in the title of this article I thought it best to start by asking it. With no particular pattern in mind, 1 asked a number of foreign friends to give me their impression of the Filipino. I was told that we were friendly, good-natured, loyal, idealistic, sentimental, socially gracious ("even the lower classes"), unwilling to accept responsibility, lacking in self-reliance, less hardworking than the Chinese, more intelligent than the Malays, imitative but less so than the Japanese, religious but not so mystical as the Indians, and, in general, the most adaptable of all the races in the Orient. A Spaniard thought we were very like the Spanish; an American thought we were Dot American enough. A Frenchman remarked we were the only people in Asia with a sense of humor, at least the only ones who could laugh at themselves, which, when one thinks of it, was probably the prettiest compliment of all. By way of contrasts, our fellow Asians had a uniform tendency to laugh at us. A Siamese said we were pretentious. An Indonesian, in much the same yein, deplored our tendency to accept western standards at their face value. A Chinese thought we were zonpresident. An Indian was shocked by the cheapness in which human life was held by a people that could kill for a few centavos, a political argument, or a girl's ruffled feelings. The history of the Philippines might well be read in these national characteristics. There is, to start with, a relatively simple explanation for our notorious lack of self-reliance, which seem to be the main burden of compliment against us these days. For mor than four centuries of colonial rule, we were not allowed to rely on ourselves. Colonialism also suggests the reason for a certain unwillingness to accept responsibility, for too long in our history, it was not accompanied by any real authority.Reflect: How is the Filipino described in the text? What qualities did you like? What about the qualities that you did not  like?All in all, it would not be too far from the truth to say that we owe our faults to others, but our virtues are our own. Colonialism, through its various interpreters, made us irresponsible and imitative, improvident, and even "indolent." It gave us false ideas of the indignity of manual labor and the security of government job. It made us indifferent to our responsibilities to ourselves.

                            10. The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.
