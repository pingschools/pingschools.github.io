                    <p>The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and coldest ocean in the world. It stretches from the North pole to Asia, Europe, and North America. The Arctic Ocean is mostly covered in sea ice all year. It is home to penguins, walruses, polar bears, and whales. Because the Ocean is so cold, few plants and animals can live there. II. Size ans Temperature The Arctic Ocean covers 5.4 million square miles. It is smaller than all the oceans. It is also the shallowest ocean. The temperature of the Arctic Ocean stays around 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius). The large amount of sea ice in the ocean stops its temperature from changing too much. However, much of the ice in the Arctic Ocean is melting because of global warming.​ Strategy Practice : was there any part of the passage that you did not understand right away?

SAMPLE SUMMARY AND PARAPHRASE 1 Hurricanes A hurricane is a very powerful storm it is a odonie storm, which means that it has a circular tem within the hurricane The name homane refers te storms that start over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean Humicanes are called different names in other oceans of the world. For example they are called typhoons in the northwest Pacific They are called cyclones in most of the rest of the world. They all have wind speeds that are most more than 75 miles per hour. The winds move in a circular pattern. The central point around which them mowes is called the eve of the storm. These storms usually develop in warm, tropical oceans. They take their energ from the seawater that evaporates Hurricanes weaken as they move over land because they depend on the seas to continue to supply energy as the storm moves. Land also has a much rougher surface than the on has much greater changes in elevation and surface. Hurricanes iose power when the winds meet the land and cause friction​</a>

On Whales Whales are mammals, so they breathe air. Since they have a layer of fat under their skins called blubber, they stay warm in the cold ocean water. They breathe through their blowholes by shooting air out of the blowholes. New air goes in through the blowholes, too. Whales do not sleep the same way humans do because they have to think about breathing. If they slept like humans do, then they would drown. Moreover, whales talk to each other. Their calls are the loudest ones of any creature on the planet and as a result, travel a very far distance through the water. Assessment 2.

They live in all the world's oceans, but they're especially abundant in warm, tropical waters. They are very intelligent creatures. Studies show that they adapt and learn very easily. They are very good at problem solving, which makes sense considering how good they are at adapting. They can be taught to unscrew a lid or remove a plug to get a prey from a container!

                                            Make an outline for this.In the sixteenth century, an age of great marine and terrestrial exploration, Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king's favor. After he was dismissed from service to the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near a latitude of 50 degrees S. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today we know it as the Strait of Magellan.One ship deserted while in this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the meridian we now call the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after ninety-eight days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellan's men died of starvation and disease.Later Magellan became involved in an insular conflict in the Philippines and was killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and seventeen sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no precipice at the edge.​</a>

 Dugongs 
Dugongs are warm-blooded sea animals. They are commonly known as "Sea Cows" because of their fondness for grazing on underwater seagrass. They are the only aquatic herbivorous mammals because they feed on plants exclusively.
What makes it more interesting is that dugongs are more closely related to elephants than another marine mammals like whales, dolphins or seals.
Dugongs swim using their whale-like tail and use their front flippers for balance and turning. They are often called as gentle giants as they move slow yet graceful. Another trait that makes them different from dolphins and whales is their ability to hold their breath for more than fifteen minutes.
These enormous vegetarians have a trunk-like flexible upper lip, thick skin covered with bristles, and nails on their forelimbs and replaceable teeth. They can weigh approximately 400 kilograms and grow up to 3 meters long. They can reach the age 70.
Dugongs can be found in the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans. Sadly, they are in danger in many parts of the world. Population that once flourished around India, Africa and other tropical Islands in the Indian Ocean are now endangered due to degradation or loss of habitat---the seagrass.
Large population of Dugongs still inhabits in the coastal Australia since they are protected by the law.

                                            Directions: Read this passage about seahorses, Box the FACT and underline the OPINION Seahorses are the best animals in the world. They are in the genus (group of species) Hippocampus, which means "horse sea monster" in Ancient Greek. There are 47 species of seahorses. Only four species live in the Pacific Ocean next to North and South America. The dwarf seahorse lives in the Bahamas. Three kinds live in the Mediterranean Sea: the long-snouted seahorse, the short-snouted seahorse, and the sea pony. Even though they are slow, I think seahorses are amazing animals to watch. According to 2009 Guinness World Records, the dwarf seahorse is the slowest-moving fish, with a top speed of about 5 feet (150 cm) per hour. Seahorses range in size from a half inch to 14 inches. Seahorses should be protected from humans who want to capture them. It is bad when humans take them out of their habitat and try to sell them. I believe that seahorses are the most magical creatures in the ocean.​</a>

                                            Amelia Earhart At the age of 23, Amelia Earhart took a ten-minute plane ride at a 1920 air show that changed her life—she knew she had to learn to fly. Because of her determination, she became a world-famous pilot. She also became a vice president in the airline industry. As a spokeswoman, she wrote and lectured about the time when flying would not be just for a few but would become an accepted part of everyday life. Earhart not only was inspirational to pilots, she broke down barriers for women. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. And that was just one of the many records she set throughout her career. Included in her accomplishments was being the first person to fly from Hawaii to California. She became the first person to make solo flights across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. All of these achievements opened opportunities for women in aviation. In 1937, Earhart attempted the first around-the-world flight at the equator. While attempting the stretch between New Guinea and Howland Island, a small island in the Pacific, Earhart and her navigator, Frederick Noonan, vanished. They were nearly two-thirds finished with the journey. No one ever found their bodies or the ultimate cause of their deaths. Recently, a piece of aluminum found on a small Pacific island called Nikumaroro is believed to match a piece that was used to repair Earhart’s plane. Though Earhart died, her legacy of freedom, determination, and living out your dreams has lived on. READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS: 1. What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage? 2. What inspired Amelia Earhart to learn how to fly? Cite evidence from the text. 3. What can you infer from the piece of aluminum found on Nikumaroro? 4.

                                            Learning Task 1 Part A. Directions: Read the passage below. The Water Cycle Have you ever wondered what happens to puddles after a big rainstorm? Each bit of precipitation in our world goes through the water cycle. The water cycle is the movement of all the water on Earth. The water in, on, and above the Earth is always moving and changing states. It changes from liquid to vapor. It changes from vapor to ice, and back again. The cycle continually repeats itself. First, the sun heats up the Earth's surface and draws water into the atmosphere. This process is called evaporation This is what makes puddles disappear! The water evaporates, changing from a liquid into a gas. Then, as the water vapor rises into the sky, it cools down. It turns back into a liquid when it is in the clouds. This part of the water cycle is called condensation. After the clouds become heavy, precipitation falls. It falls as rain, snow, hail, or sleet. Sometimes precipitation can fall in heavy amounts. This can cause flooding and problems for people and animals on Earth. Mountainous areas, places that typically have snow, experience melting when the temperatures rise. The snowmelt runs down toward sea level. As the runoff reaches lower elevations, it can end up in lakes and rivers, eventually leading to the ocean. This part of the process is called collection. Water is collected in different places on the Earth. It can be absorbed back into trees and plants. It can return to lakes, rivers, and the ocean. The water can freeze into snow, ice, or glaciers, depending on the climate. The water cycle is a system in nature that is constantly moving. The steps always occur in the same order, and the cycle always repeats itself . Directions: Complete the chart with details from the text/passage that show the correct sequence of water cycle. First, Next, After that, Then, Finally, Part B. Directions. Read the definitions below and put the corresponding term in the spaces marking each part of the cycle in the diagram. Evaporation: Liquid water is heated by the sun until it rises as water vapor into the atmosphere. Precipitation: Water falling to the Earth in the form of weather - including rain, sleet, hail and snow Condensation: Water vapor molecules join together, becoming liquid, in the form of clouds. The Sun: Creates all of the weather on Earth through the uneven heating of Earth's surface. Liquid Water: All living things need this to survive and it is an important part of the weather system.​</a>

As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king's favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain. A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.One ship deserted while in this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellan's men died of starvation and disease.Later, Magellan became involved in an insular conflict in the Philippines and was killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and 17 sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no precipice at the edge.​</a>

Their hearts, as much as an automobile.Blue whales reach this size on a diet composed nearly exclusively of tiny shrimp-like animals called krill. During certain times of the year, a single adult blue whale consumes about 4 tons of krill a day.The giant animals feed by first gulping an enormous mouthful of water, expanding the pleated skin on their throat and belly to take it in. Then the whale's massive tongue forces the water out through the thin, overlapping plates. Thousands of krill are left behind—and then swallowed.Blue whales live in all the world's oceans occasionally swimming in small groups but usually alone or in pairs. They often spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives.a. Information about different sea animalsb. Information about Blue Whalesc.

 Dugongs 
1. Dugongs are warm-blooded sea animals. They are commonly known as "Sea Cows" because of their fondness for grazing on underwater seagrass. They are the only aquatic herbivorous mammals because they feed on plants exclusively.
2. What makes it more interesting is that dugongs are more closely related to elephants than another marine mammals like whales, dolphins or seals.
3. Dugongs swim using their whale-like tail and use their front flippers for balance and turning. They are often called as gentle giants as they move slow yet graceful. Another trait that makes them different from dolphins and whales is their ability to hold their breath for more than fifteen minutes.
4. These enormous vegetarians have a trunk-like flexible upper lip, thick skin covered with bristles, and nails on their forelimbs and replaceable teeth. They can weigh approximately 400 kilograms and grow up to 3 meters long. They can reach the age 70.
5. Dugongs can be found in the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans. Sadly, they are in danger in many parts of the world. Population that once flourished around India, Africa and other tropical Islands in the Indian Ocean are now endangered due to degradation or loss of habitat---the seagrass.
6.Large population of Dugongs still inhabits in the coastal Australia since they are protected by the law.
Questions:
1. What is the passage about? Why are they called as gentle giants?
2. How are Dugongs classified as herbivorous? Support your answer.
3.Why are Dugongs closely related to elephants than other marine mammals like dolphins, whales and seals? What statements in the passage support your answer?
4. What do you think are the reasons why dugongs become endangered?
5. What can we do to prevent the extinction of these animals?</a>

Plastic PollutionDid you know that every year 8 milliontons of plastic end up in our planet's beautifulblue oceans? And that's seriously bad newsfor our friends beneath the waves...Over 700 species of marineanimals have been reported to have eaten orbeen entangled in plastic - and scientiststhink that the amount of plastic in the oceanmay triple by 2050! But here is the good news – by understanding the issue andtaking action, you can help change the future and make our oceans a clean,safe place for our wonderful wildlife!The problem is that most of us use more plastic than we need to, and half ofthe plastic we produce is designed to be used just once and chucked away. Thisso-called 'single-use plastic is used to make all kinds of items, such as shoppingbags, straws, food wrappers and various packaging. And because plastictakes over 400 years to decompose (break down), it stays in the natural world,causing damage, for a very long time.Scientists think that a whopping 8.8 million tons of plastic end up in the oceanevery year. That is the same as stacking five plastic shopping bags of rubbishon top of each other on every meter of coastline in the world! But how does it allget there?One way is through 'ocean dumping, when people illegally tip largeamounts of waste directly into the sea. But not all plastic in the ocean is dumpedthere on purpose. In fact, around 80% plastic in the sea comes from the land...Animals and birds can get trapped, tangled, and even strangled by allkinds of plastic waste, such as discarded fishing nets and six-pack rings from drink cans.they also mistakes small bits of plastic such as bottle tops and wrappers for food and gobble them up leaving no room in their swollen thumb is for real food and the problem does not end there by working together our choices can help clean up the ocean and make it a safe place for our amazing marine life Questions:1.what type of informational/factual text is the passage above?a.expositoryb.factual descriptionc.factual recountd.persuasive2.what is the purpose of this type of text?a.to persuadeb.to entairtainc.to described.to narrate3.what kind of verb is the word"can" in the last paragraph?a.sensingb.linkingc.nounsd.action4.what part of speech are the parenthesis?"(whopping)8.8million,(shopping) bags,(amazing) marine life".a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbs5.what part of speech are the following---pollution,news,ocean,scientists?a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbsplsss answer my question i mark you as a brainliest and i give you 25 points​</a>

The Arctic Ocean is mostly covered in sea ice all year. It is home to penguins, walruses, polar bears, and whales. Because the Ocean is so cold, few plants and animals can live there. II. Size ans Temperature The Arctic Ocean covers 5.4 million square miles. It is smaller than all the oceans. It is also the shallowest ocean. The temperature of the Arctic Ocean stays around 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius). The large amount of sea ice in the ocean stops its temperature from changing too much. However, much of the ice in the Arctic Ocean is melting because of global warming.​ Strategy Practice : was there any part of the passage that you did not understand right away?

On Whales Whales are mammals, so they breathe air. Since they have a layer of fat under their skins called blubber, they stay warm in the cold ocean water. They breathe through their blowholes by shooting air out of the blowholes. New air goes in through the blowholes, too. Whales do not sleep the same way humans do because they have to think about breathing. If they slept like humans do, then they would drown. Moreover, whales talk to each other. Their calls are the loudest ones of any creature on the planet and as a result, travel a very far distance through the water. Assessment 2.

As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king's favor. After he was dismissed from service to the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near a latitude of 50 degrees S.

 Dugongs 
Dugongs are warm-blooded sea animals. They are commonly known as "Sea Cows" because of their fondness for grazing on underwater seagrass. They are the only aquatic herbivorous mammals because they feed on plants exclusively.
What makes it more interesting is that dugongs are more closely related to elephants than another marine mammals like whales, dolphins or seals.
Dugongs swim using their whale-like tail and use their front flippers for balance and turning. They are often called as gentle giants as they move slow yet graceful. Another trait that makes them different from dolphins and whales is their ability to hold their breath for more than fifteen minutes.
These enormous vegetarians have a trunk-like flexible upper lip, thick skin covered with bristles, and nails on their forelimbs and replaceable teeth. They can weigh approximately 400 kilograms and grow up to 3 meters long. They can reach the age 70.
Dugongs can be found in the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans. Sadly, they are in danger in many parts of the world. Population that once flourished around India, Africa and other tropical Islands in the Indian Ocean are now endangered due to degradation or loss of habitat---the seagrass.
Large population of Dugongs still inhabits in the coastal Australia since they are protected by the law.

They are in the genus (group of species) Hippocampus, which means "horse sea monster" in Ancient Greek. There are 47 species of seahorses. Only four species live in the Pacific Ocean next to North and South America. The dwarf seahorse lives in the Bahamas. Three kinds live in the Mediterranean Sea: the long-snouted seahorse, the short-snouted seahorse, and the sea pony. Even though they are slow, I think seahorses are amazing animals to watch. According to 2009 Guinness World Records, the dwarf seahorse is the slowest-moving fish, with a top speed of about 5 feet (150 cm) per hour. Seahorses range in size from a half inch to 14 inches. Seahorses should be protected from humans who want to capture them. It is bad when humans take them out of their habitat and try to sell them. I believe that seahorses are the most magical creatures in the ocean.​</h2><br />

                            15. Amelia Earhart At the age of 23, Amelia Earhart took a ten-minute plane ride at a 1920 air show that changed her life—she knew she had to learn to fly. Because of her determination, she became a world-famous pilot. She also became a vice president in the airline industry. As a spokeswoman, she wrote and lectured about the time when flying would not be just for a few but would become an accepted part of everyday life. Earhart not only was inspirational to pilots, she broke down barriers for women. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. And that was just one of the many records she set throughout her career. Included in her accomplishments was being the first person to fly from Hawaii to California. She became the first person to make solo flights across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. All of these achievements opened opportunities for women in aviation. In 1937, Earhart attempted the first around-the-world flight at the equator. While attempting the stretch between New Guinea and Howland Island, a small island in the Pacific, Earhart and her navigator, Frederick Noonan, vanished. They were nearly two-thirds finished with the journey. No one ever found their bodies or the ultimate cause of their deaths. Recently, a piece of aluminum found on a small Pacific island called Nikumaroro is believed to match a piece that was used to repair Earhart’s plane. Though Earhart died, her legacy of freedom, determination, and living out your dreams has lived on. READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS: 1. What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage? 2.

                            17. Learning Task 1 Part A. Directions: Read the passage below. The Water Cycle Have you ever wondered what happens to puddles after a big rainstorm? Each bit of precipitation in our world goes through the water cycle. The water cycle is the movement of all the water on Earth. The water in, on, and above the Earth is always moving and changing states. It changes from liquid to vapor. It changes from vapor to ice, and back again. The cycle continually repeats itself. First, the sun heats up the Earth's surface and draws water into the atmosphere. This process is called evaporation This is what makes puddles disappear! The water evaporates, changing from a liquid into a gas. Then, as the water vapor rises into the sky, it cools down. It turns back into a liquid when it is in the clouds. This part of the water cycle is called condensation. After the clouds become heavy, precipitation falls. It falls as rain, snow, hail, or sleet. Sometimes precipitation can fall in heavy amounts. This can cause flooding and problems for people and animals on Earth. Mountainous areas, places that typically have snow, experience melting when the temperatures rise. The snowmelt runs down toward sea level. As the runoff reaches lower elevations, it can end up in lakes and rivers, eventually leading to the ocean. This part of the process is called collection. Water is collected in different places on the Earth. It can be absorbed back into trees and plants. It can return to lakes, rivers, and the ocean. The water can freeze into snow, ice, or glaciers, depending on the climate. The water cycle is a system in nature that is constantly moving. The steps always occur in the same order, and the cycle always repeats itself . Directions: Complete the chart with details from the text/passage that show the correct sequence of water cycle. First, Next, After that, Then, Finally, Part B. Directions. Read the definitions below and put the corresponding term in the spaces marking each part of the cycle in the diagram. Evaporation: Liquid water is heated by the sun until it rises as water vapor into the atmosphere. Precipitation: Water falling to the Earth in the form of weather - including rain, sleet, hail and snow Condensation: Water vapor molecules join together, becoming liquid, in the form of clouds. The Sun: Creates all of the weather on Earth through the uneven heating of Earth's surface. Liquid Water: All living things need this to survive and it is an important part of the weather system.​</h2><br />

                            18. Read the passage below. Then, fill in the needed information.In the 16th century, an age of great marine and terrestrial exploration, Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king's favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain. A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.One ship deserted while in this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellan's men died of starvation and disease.Later, Magellan became involved in an insular conflict in the Philippines and was killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and 17 sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no precipice at the edge.​</h2><br />

                            19. What point below accurately summarizes the below passage?Blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons. Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.Blue whales reach this size on a diet composed nearly exclusively of tiny shrimp-like animals called krill. During certain times of the year, a single adult blue whale consumes about 4 tons of krill a day.The giant animals feed by first gulping an enormous mouthful of water, expanding the pleated skin on their throat and belly to take it in. Then the whale's massive tongue forces the water out through the thin, overlapping plates. Thousands of krill are left behind—and then swallowed.Blue whales live in all the world's oceans occasionally swimming in small groups but usually alone or in pairs. They often spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives.a. Information about different sea animalsb. Information about Blue Whalesc.

                            23. Direction: Read the selection below. Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. 
 Dugongs 
1. Dugongs are warm-blooded sea animals. They are commonly known as "Sea Cows" because of their fondness for grazing on underwater seagrass. They are the only aquatic herbivorous mammals because they feed on plants exclusively.
2. What makes it more interesting is that dugongs are more closely related to elephants than another marine mammals like whales, dolphins or seals.
3. Dugongs swim using their whale-like tail and use their front flippers for balance and turning. They are often called as gentle giants as they move slow yet graceful. Another trait that makes them different from dolphins and whales is their ability to hold their breath for more than fifteen minutes.
4. These enormous vegetarians have a trunk-like flexible upper lip, thick skin covered with bristles, and nails on their forelimbs and replaceable teeth. They can weigh approximately 400 kilograms and grow up to 3 meters long. They can reach the age 70.
5. Dugongs can be found in the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans. Sadly, they are in danger in many parts of the world. Population that once flourished around India, Africa and other tropical Islands in the Indian Ocean are now endangered due to degradation or loss of habitat---the seagrass.
6.Large population of Dugongs still inhabits in the coastal Australia since they are protected by the law.

1. What is the passage about? Why are they called as gentle giants?
2. How are Dugongs classified as herbivorous? Support your answer.

Plastic PollutionDid you know that every year 8 milliontons of plastic end up in our planet's beautifulblue oceans? And that's seriously bad newsfor our friends beneath the waves...Over 700 species of marineanimals have been reported to have eaten orbeen entangled in plastic - and scientiststhink that the amount of plastic in the oceanmay triple by 2050! But here is the good news – by understanding the issue andtaking action, you can help change the future and make our oceans a clean,safe place for our wonderful wildlife!The problem is that most of us use more plastic than we need to, and half ofthe plastic we produce is designed to be used just once and chucked away. Thisso-called 'single-use plastic is used to make all kinds of items, such as shoppingbags, straws, food wrappers and various packaging. And because plastictakes over 400 years to decompose (break down), it stays in the natural world,causing damage, for a very long time.Scientists think that a whopping 8.8 million tons of plastic end up in the oceanevery year. That is the same as stacking five plastic shopping bags of rubbishon top of each other on every meter of coastline in the world! But how does it allget there?One way is through 'ocean dumping, when people illegally tip largeamounts of waste directly into the sea. But not all plastic in the ocean is dumpedthere on purpose. In fact, around 80% plastic in the sea comes from the land...Animals and birds can get trapped, tangled, and even strangled by allkinds of plastic waste, such as discarded fishing nets and six-pack rings from drink cans.they also mistakes small bits of plastic such as bottle tops and wrappers for food and gobble them up leaving no room in their swollen thumb is for real food and the problem does not end there by working together our choices can help clean up the ocean and make it a safe place for our amazing marine life Questions:1.what type of informational/factual text is the passage above?a.expositoryb.factual descriptionc.factual recountd.persuasive2.what is the purpose of this type of text?a.to persuadeb.to entairtainc.to described.to narrate3.what kind of verb is the word"can" in the last paragraph?a.sensingb.linkingc.nounsd.action4.what part of speech are the parenthesis?"(whopping)8.8million,(shopping) bags,(amazing) marine life".a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbs5.what part of speech are the following---pollution,news,ocean,scientists?a.adjectivesb.connectivesc.nounsd.verbsplsss answer my question i mark you as a brainliest and i give you 25 points​</h2><br />
