                                            1. For many years, all books were written by hand. Because it took so long to write one book, there were only a few of them. Most people could never own a book. Then sometime between 1450 and 1460, Johannes Gutenberg got the idea of carving separate letters and moving them to make new words. Gutenberg died at the age of 68. This was the invention of the moveabletype. From then on, the number of books printed grew quickly.Irrelevant information:_________________2. The solar system is believed to have formed, perhaps 5 billion years ago, from a spinning cloud of gas called a nebula. As this nebula contracted it began to spin faster and faster, Probably it spun off rings of planetary matter as it became more disk-like. These rings latercontracted into planets. Earth is the third planet from the Sun.Irrelevant Information:_________________3. Some people do not know that the whale is a mammal just like a human. Humpback whales will sometimes leap clear up out of the water, an act known as breaching. A humpback whale can weigh thirty tons and measure 15 meters in length. So, it takes an enormous amount of energy for a whale to breach. Irrelevant information:_________________4. The largest organ in the human body is the skin. One of the skin's functions is to helpregulate the amount of body heat that flows in and out of the body. Heavy smoking ages skin very quickly. When it is cold, we cover the skin with extra layers of clothing to slow down the outward flow of heat. When it is hot, the evaporation of sweat cools us down.Irrelevant information:_________________​</a>

                                             There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were-she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent." A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing- room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day.

Some people have a hard time remembering to get their loved one’s appropriate gifts on Valentine’s Day. This can lead to painfully long talks about “where the relationship stands”. Perhaps the best way to avoid these talks is by taking the moral highroad. Instead of forgetting these holidays, choose not to celebrate them. Inform your loved one that you don’t want to buy into the materialism and commercialism of these manufactured holidays. Tell that person that you want to have a relationship with them, not the marketers, and that you want to celebrate your love every day, not just one day a year. It’s a tough pitch, but if you can make the sale then you’ll be in the clear for life.

Sir Isaac Newton was contemplating the universe in his garden one day in 1665 when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. Newton wondered to himself, “Why should the apple always fall to the ground? Why does it not go sideways or upwards but directly toward the Earth’s center?” After much contemplation, Newton concluded that objects are pulled to the Earth through a force that he called gravity, which means heaviness in Latin. On July 5th, 1687 Newton formally expressed his law of universal gravitation in a series of books called The Principia.

                                            Read and analyze the paragraph. On a separate sheet, identify the sentence that is irrelevant to the given topic. 1. The longest - lived creature in the insect world is the queen termite (ant). She has been known to live for over 50 years. During that time, the queen can lay over 30,000 eggs each day. So, in her 50 years of life, it is possible for her to give birth to half a billion children. Some termite hills can be over six meters high. 2. For many years, all books were written by hand. Since it took so long to write one book, there were only a few of them. Most people could never own a book. Then sometime between 1450 and 1460, Johannes Gutenberg got the idea of carving separate letters and moving them to make new words . Gutenberg died at the age of 68. This was the invention of moveable type. From then on, the numbers of books printed grew quickly. 3. The solar system is believed to have formed, perhaps 5 billion years ago, from a spinning cloud of gas called a nebula. As this nebula contracted it began to spin faster and faster. Probably it spun off rings of planetary matter as it became more disk like. These rings later contracted into planets. Earth is the third planet from the Sun. 4. Some people do not know that the whale is a mammal just like a human. Humpback whales will sometimes leap clear up put of the water, an act known as breaching. A humpback whale can weigh thirty tons and measures 15 meters in length. So it takes an enormous amount of energy for a whale to breach. 5. The largest organ in the body is the skin. One of the skin's function is to help regulate the amount of body heat that flows in and out of the body. Heavy smoking ages skin very quickly. When it is cold, we cover the skin with extra layers of clothing to slow down the outward flow of heat. When it is hot, evaporation is sweat cools us down.​</a>

                                            There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner— something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.” “What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked. “Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.” A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.​</a>

                            6. 1. For many years, all books were written by hand. Because it took so long to write one book, there were only a few of them. Most people could never own a book. Then sometime between 1450 and 1460, Johannes Gutenberg got the idea of carving separate letters and moving them to make new words. Gutenberg died at the age of 68. This was the invention of the moveabletype. From then on, the number of books printed grew quickly.Irrelevant information:_________________2. The solar system is believed to have formed, perhaps 5 billion years ago, from a spinning cloud of gas called a nebula. As this nebula contracted it began to spin faster and faster, Probably it spun off rings of planetary matter as it became more disk-like. These rings latercontracted into planets. Earth is the third planet from the Sun.Irrelevant Information:_________________3. Some people do not know that the whale is a mammal just like a human. Humpback whales will sometimes leap clear up out of the water, an act known as breaching. A humpback whale can weigh thirty tons and measure 15 meters in length. So, it takes an enormous amount of energy for a whale to breach. Irrelevant information:_________________4. The largest organ in the human body is the skin. One of the skin's functions is to helpregulate the amount of body heat that flows in and out of the body. Heavy smoking ages skin very quickly. When it is cold, we cover the skin with extra layers of clothing to slow down the outward flow of heat. When it is hot, the evaporation of sweat cools us down.Irrelevant information:_________________​</h2><br />

                            10.  There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were-she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent." A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing- room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.

Some people have a hard time remembering to get their loved one’s appropriate gifts on Valentine’s Day. This can lead to painfully long talks about “where the relationship stands”. Perhaps the best way to avoid these talks is by taking the moral highroad. Instead of forgetting these holidays, choose not to celebrate them. Inform your loved one that you don’t want to buy into the materialism and commercialism of these manufactured holidays. Tell that person that you want to have a relationship with them, not the marketers, and that you want to celebrate your love every day, not just one day a year. It’s a tough pitch, but if you can make the sale then you’ll be in the clear for life.

Sir Isaac Newton was contemplating the universe in his garden one day in 1665 when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. Newton wondered to himself, “Why should the apple always fall to the ground? Why does it not go sideways or upwards but directly toward the Earth’s center?” After much contemplation, Newton concluded that objects are pulled to the Earth through a force that he called gravity, which means heaviness in Latin. On July 5th, 1687 Newton formally expressed his law of universal gravitation in a series of books called The Principia.

                            22. Read and analyze the paragraph. On a separate sheet, identify the sentence that is irrelevant to the given topic. 1. The longest - lived creature in the insect world is the queen termite (ant). She has been known to live for over 50 years. During that time, the queen can lay over 30,000 eggs each day. So, in her 50 years of life, it is possible for her to give birth to half a billion children. Some termite hills can be over six meters high. 2. For many years, all books were written by hand. Since it took so long to write one book, there were only a few of them. Most people could never own a book. Then sometime between 1450 and 1460, Johannes Gutenberg got the idea of carving separate letters and moving them to make new words . Gutenberg died at the age of 68. This was the invention of moveable type. From then on, the numbers of books printed grew quickly. 3. The solar system is believed to have formed, perhaps 5 billion years ago, from a spinning cloud of gas called a nebula. As this nebula contracted it began to spin faster and faster. Probably it spun off rings of planetary matter as it became more disk like. These rings later contracted into planets. Earth is the third planet from the Sun. 4. Some people do not know that the whale is a mammal just like a human. Humpback whales will sometimes leap clear up put of the water, an act known as breaching. A humpback whale can weigh thirty tons and measures 15 meters in length. So it takes an enormous amount of energy for a whale to breach. 5. The largest organ in the body is the skin. One of the skin's function is to help regulate the amount of body heat that flows in and out of the body. Heavy smoking ages skin very quickly. When it is cold, we cover the skin with extra layers of clothing to slow down the outward flow of heat. When it is hot, evaporation is sweat cools us down.​</h2><br />

                            30. There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner— something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.” “What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked. “Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.” A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This piece is entitled " Jane Eyre".</p><p>Jane Eyre is a novel written by Charlotte Brontë in 1847. The novel follows the story of Jane, a seemingly plain and simple girl as she battles through life's struggles. Jane has many obstacles in her life - her cruel and abusive Aunt Reed, the grim conditions at Lowood school, her love for Rochester and Rochester's marriage to Bertha. However, Jane overcomes these obstacles through her determination, sharp wit and courage. The novel ends with Jane married to Rochester with children of their own.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are elements of Jane Eyre that echo Charlotte Brontë's own life. She and her sisters went to a school run by a headmaster as severe as Mr Brocklehurst. Two of Charlotte's sisters died there from tuberculosis (just like Jane's only friend, Helen Burns). Charlotte Brontë was also a governess for some years before turning to writing.
