The title should be appropriate for the intended audience. ● The title usually describes the subject matter of the article. For example: Effect of Smoking on Academic Performance. 9 Sometimes a title that summarizes the results is more effective. Example: Students Who Smoke Get Lower Grades. • Titles with colons are currently in vogue but usually they are not as cute as you think they are when you first think of them. Activity 2 Directions.

The theory of 1. proposes that meteors carried organic molecules here on Earth; it's where the extra-terrestrial origin is being formulated. Furthermore, another theory named 2. origin proposes that life came from inanimate objects. The Miller- Urey experiment paved way for the discovery of 3. in the atmosphere in which the organisms are mostly composed of. The examples of (3) are 4. 5. 6. etc. Then we have the Oparin's Bubble Theory which is also called as the theory of 7. The earliest cell evidences let us discover the early life here on earth, such evidences include the 8. Another evidence is the archaebacteria which means "ancient bacteria", example to this one is the 9. Another bacteria is the Eubacteria, where its main feature is being 10 or the ability to capture light as an energy.​</a>

Read the following guidelines in constructing a research title to help you create your own: • Make the title specific enough to describe the contents of the paper, but not so technical that only specialists will understand. The title should be appropriate for the intended audience. ● The title usually describes the subject matter of the article. For example: Effect of Smoking on Academic Performance. • Sometimes a title that summarizes the results is more effective. Example: Students Who Smoke Get Lower Grades.
