                                            The traditional J2EE application contains an excessive amount mportance in the application. Such an approach distracts the developers from focusing on the application’s business domain. Also, the J2EE applications are tough to take through the testing phase. Because of the problems, a tool based code generation approach was adopted; however, it was a failure. With such experiences in mind, frameworks were introduced. Frameworks provide great flexibility during the runtime. Spring is a very powerful and lightweight application development framework.</a>

                            28. The traditional J2EE application contains an excessive amount mportance in the application. Such an approach distracts the developers from focusing on the application’s business domain. Also, the J2EE applications are tough to take through the testing phase. Because of the problems, a tool based code generation approach was adopted; however, it was a failure. With such experiences in mind, frameworks were introduced. Frameworks provide great flexibility during the runtime. Spring is a very powerful and lightweight application development framework.</h2><br />
