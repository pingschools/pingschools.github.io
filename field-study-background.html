Background of study
BACKGROUND OF STUDY
This study focuses on Students preferred program for Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) Strand students at Philippine College of Criminology. Researchers used survey questionnaires to acquire information regarding the implications of the factors that influence the choice courses. The questionnaire made it simple to gather ideas.
HYPHOTHESIS
Socioeconomic status must be taken into account as it directs us toward the right careers and educational paths. Our socioeconomic situation will also enable us to understand the requirements for a given profession. For instance, pursuing a job in the medical field might be beneficial in the long run given the high demand in that field.
SCOPE AND DELIMITATION 
60% of the students we survey chose that their preferred course was BS CRIM and 40% Of the survey chose different courses. The expectation this first semester of the 2022-2023 school year is that there are more programs to come to open their minds in what course do they want to choose.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The influence of family, specifically parents, on the career decisions of their children, and how gender and socioeconomic status influence this choice, has been examined. Research was carried out using data obtained from a questionnaire administered to students who took the university entrance examination Philippine college of criminology.
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
Humanities and Social Sciences in Philippine College of Criminology preferred program choosing a college course/degree. strand is intended for those who wish to explore careers in social sciences. strand will involve a lot of research and presentation, making it a good preparation for their future careers.</a>

Literature review must be presented in a clear and organized manner.2. In making related literature of your research, presentation of information needs to be short with considerable errors3. The related literature and studies must be relevant to the specialized field or discipline4. It is considerable to include literature and studies that are outdated.5. Presentation of literature review can be in deductive or inductive manner depending on point of view of the researcher6. The main purpose of literature review is to provide background of the study7. Research questions are expounded in the literature review.8. A research may still be conducted without a review of related literature and studies.9. Literature review contains a very long discussion of studies' processes, findings, and implication10. Literature has to be accomplished by means of providing credible informationASAP​</a>

Researchers have a wide range of fields to choose from3. “How often”, and “How many” can be used in stating a research question in descriptive research studies4. The research title must be very general to have a more compressed title5. Previous research studies are essential in identifying a research topic6. A research title must give all details of the study7. Variables are introduced in the background of the study8. An experimental study is always quantitative9. A descriptive study measures the cause and effect of the variables10. Ex post facto describes the events observed in a phenomenon11. It is important to put the research gaps in the background of the study12. The research gap is a significant topic of interest that were not addressed from preliminary research studies13. An excellent research title must start with the phrase, “A Study…”14. A research study does not consider the length of time in conducting an investigation 15.

Background of study
BACKGROUND OF STUDY
This study focuses on Students preferred program for Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) Strand students at Philippine College of Criminology. Researchers used survey questionnaires to acquire information regarding the implications of the factors that influence the choice courses. The questionnaire made it simple to gather ideas.
HYPHOTHESIS
Socioeconomic status must be taken into account as it directs us toward the right careers and educational paths. Our socioeconomic situation will also enable us to understand the requirements for a given profession. For instance, pursuing a job in the medical field might be beneficial in the long run given the high demand in that field.
SCOPE AND DELIMITATION 
60% of the students we survey chose that their preferred course was BS CRIM and 40% Of the survey chose different courses. The expectation this first semester of the 2022-2023 school year is that there are more programs to come to open their minds in what course do they want to choose.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The influence of family, specifically parents, on the career decisions of their children, and how gender and socioeconomic status influence this choice, has been examined. Research was carried out using data obtained from a questionnaire administered to students who took the university entrance examination Philippine college of criminology.
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
Humanities and Social Sciences in Philippine College of Criminology preferred program choosing a college course/degree. strand is intended for those who wish to explore careers in social sciences. strand will involve a lot of research and presentation, making it a good preparation for their future careers.</h2><br />

Acronyms are more preferred to be used in writing a research title2. Researchers have a wide range of fields to choose from3. “How often”, and “How many” can be used in stating a research question in descriptive research studies4. The research title must be very general to have a more compressed title5. Previous research studies are essential in identifying a research topic6. A research title must give all details of the study7. Variables are introduced in the background of the study8. An experimental study is always quantitative9. A descriptive study measures the cause and effect of the variables10. Ex post facto describes the events observed in a phenomenon11. It is important to put the research gaps in the background of the study12. The research gap is a significant topic of interest that were not addressed from preliminary research studies13. An excellent research title must start with the phrase, “A Study…”14. A research study does not consider the length of time in conducting an investigation 15.
